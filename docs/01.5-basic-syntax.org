* ✅ Introduction
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:42]

Org-mode uses a lightweight markup syntax that stays readable as plain text while providing rich formatting when rendered. This document covers the fundamental syntax elements you'll use in everyday writing.

The philosophy is simple: markup should be intuitive and unobtrusive. When you read an org file as plain text, the meaning is clear. When exported or rendered, the formatting appears polished.

* ✅ Text Markup
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:42]

Text markup in org-mode uses paired delimiters around words or phrases. The key rule: markup delimiters must be adjacent to the text they format, with whitespace or punctuation on the outside.

** ✅ Emphasis Styles
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:42]

Here's how to emphasize text in your writing:

When you want to make a point *strongly*, use asterisks for *bold text*. This draws the reader's attention to key concepts or important warnings.

For a gentler emphasis, /italic text/ works well for /introducing new terms/, book titles like /The Art of Computer Programming/, or adding subtle stress to a phrase.

Sometimes you need to mark text as _underlined_ to indicate _titles_ or _special significance_. Underlines appear less frequently in modern writing but remain useful.

To indicate that something has been removed or is no longer valid, use +strikethrough+. This is handy for todo lists: +buy milk+ done!

** ✅ Literal Text
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:42]

When writing about code or technical content, you need text that renders exactly as typed:

Use =verbatim= for file paths like =/usr/local/bin=, environment variables like =PATH=, or any text that should appear in a monospace font without interpretation.

The ~code~ markup is similar but semantically indicates program code: ~print("hello")~, variable names like ~myVariable~, or command names like ~grep~.

The difference is subtle—both render similarly, but =verbatim= suggests literal text while ~code~ suggests executable code.

** ✅ Markup Rules
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:42]

Markup only works when the delimiters are properly placed:

- The opening delimiter must follow whitespace or punctuation: start of line, space, or characters like =(=, =[=, ={=
- The closing delimiter must precede whitespace or punctuation: end of line, space, period, comma, etc.
- No whitespace immediately inside the delimiters

These work: *bold*, /italic/, text with *bold* inside, (*bold in parens*)

These don't: * bold * (spaces inside), *bold * (trailing space), word*bold* (no preceding space)

** ✅ Combining Markup
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:42]

You can nest markup for combined effects, though keep it readable:

This is */bold and italic/*. Or try _/underlined italic/_ for something different.

The outer delimiter is processed first, so */bold italic/* has bold as the primary emphasis containing italic text.

* ✅ Lists
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:43]

Lists are fundamental to organized writing. Org-mode supports three types: unordered (bullet), ordered (numbered), and definition lists.

** ✅ Unordered Lists
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:43]

Start a line with a dash, plus, or asterisk followed by a space:

- First item in the list
- Second item continues the thought
- Third item wraps up

You can also use =+= or =*= as bullets (though =*= can conflict with headlines at the start of a line):

+ Alternative bullet style
+ Some prefer this look
+ It's a matter of taste

** ✅ Ordered Lists
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:43]

For sequences where order matters, use numbers followed by a period or parenthesis:

1. First, gather your materials
2. Next, prepare the workspace
3. Then, begin the actual work
4. Finally, clean up when done

The numbers auto-increment conceptually, and you can use letters too:

a. Option A: the simple approach
b. Option B: more complex but powerful
c. Option C: advanced users only

** ✅ Nested Lists
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:43]

Indent items to create hierarchy. Use consistent indentation (typically 2-3 spaces):

- Main topic
  - Subtopic one
    - Detail about subtopic one
    - Another detail
  - Subtopic two
- Another main topic
  - With its own subtopics

You can mix ordered and unordered:

1. First major step
   - Consider this aspect
   - And this one too
2. Second major step
   - More considerations
   - Final thoughts

** ✅ Definition Lists
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:43]

When you need to define terms, use the =::= separator:

- term :: The word or phrase being defined
- definition :: An explanation of what something means
- org-mode :: A major mode for Emacs that provides outlining, task management, and literate programming

Definition lists are perfect for:

- glossaries :: Collections of term definitions
- parameter docs :: Explaining function arguments
- feature lists :: Describing capabilities with explanations

The term appears before =::= and the definition follows. Long definitions wrap naturally to subsequent lines.

** ✅ Checkboxes
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 19:35]

Add checkboxes to list items for task tracking:

- [ ] Task not yet started
- [-] Task in progress (partially complete)
- [X] Task completed

Toggle checkboxes with =C-c C-c= when the cursor is on the line.

Parent items can show progress:

- Project tasks [2/3]
  - [x] Design the interface
  - [X] Implement the backend
  - [ ] Write documentation

The =[1/3]= updates automatically as you check off subtasks. You can also use percentage format =[33%]=.

You can use an attribute to create radio button style checkboxes where only one item can be selected:

#+attr_org: :radio t                
 - [ ] Option A                        
 - [ ] Option B  
 - [X] Option C   

* ✅ Paragraphs and Line Breaks
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 19:36]

Paragraphs are simply blocks of text separated by blank lines:

This is the first paragraph. It can contain multiple sentences that flow together naturally. The text wraps based on your editor settings.

This is the second paragraph. The blank line above separates it from the first. Each paragraph represents a distinct thought or topic.

** ✅ Preserving Line Breaks
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 19:36]

Normally, single line breaks within a paragraph are treated as spaces when exported. To force a line break, end the line with =\\=:

| Line one of the address\\
| Line two\\
| City, State ZIP

Or use verse blocks for poetry and formatted text:

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Org-mode is lovely,
And so are you.
#+END_VERSE

* ✅ Horizontal Rules
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:45]

Create a horizontal divider with five or more dashes on a line by themselves:

Some content above the rule.

-----

Content continues below the rule.

Horizontal rules help separate major sections or indicate a scene break in narrative writing.

* ✅ Equations and Mathematics
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:45]

Org-mode supports LaTeX math notation for scientific and technical writing.

** ✅ Inline Math
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:45]

For mathematics within a sentence, use =$...$= or =\(...\)=:

The famous equation $E = mc^2$ changed physics forever. Einstein showed that energy and mass are equivalent, with the speed of light $c$ as the conversion factor.

In statistics, the mean $\mu = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$ summarizes a dataset. The standard deviation $\sigma$ measures spread around that mean.

The quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\) solves any quadratic equation.

** ✅ Display Math
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:45]

For equations that deserve their own line, use =$$...$$= or =\[...\]=:

The Gaussian integral is remarkably elegant:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$

Maxwell's equations in differential form:

\[\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}\]

\[\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0\]

** ✅ Equation Environments
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:45]

For numbered equations or aligned systems, use LaTeX environments:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{equation}
  f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} e^{-t^2} dt
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT

Or for aligned equations:

\begin{align}
  a &= b + c \\
  d &= e + f + g
\end{align}

** ✅ Math Preview
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:45]

In Scimax VS Code, hover over math expressions to see a rendered preview. See [[file:11-latex-preview.org][LaTeX Preview]] for full details.

* ✅ Footnotes
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:45]

Add footnotes for supplementary information that would interrupt the main flow:

Org-mode[fn:1] provides excellent support for academic writing. You can place footnotes anywhere in the document[fn:2], and they render appropriately on export.

[fn:1] Originally developed by Carsten Dominik starting in 2003.

[fn:2] Footnote definitions can appear anywhere, but placing them near their reference aids readability.

** ✅ Inline Footnotes
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 19:36]

For quick notes, use inline footnotes that combine reference and definition:

The algorithm runs in O(n log n) time[fn:: This assumes a comparison-based sort; radix sort can achieve O(n) for integers.], making it practical for large datasets.

** ✅ Named Footnotes
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 19:36]

Use descriptive names for footnotes you reference multiple times:

As noted in the original paper[fn:smith2020], the results were reproducible[fn:smith2020].

[fn:smith2020] Smith et al., "Reproducibility in Science," Journal of Methods, 2020.

* ✅ Block Elements
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:49]

Org-mode uses =#+BEGIN_...= and =#+END_...= pairs for special block content.

** ✅ Quote Blocks
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:49]

For quotations:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
— Steve Jobs
#+END_QUOTE

** ✅ Example Blocks
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:49]

For preformatted text that should render literally:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
This text appears exactly as typed.
  Indentation is preserved.
    *Markup* is not processed.
#+END_EXAMPLE

** ✅ Center Blocks
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:49]

For centered text:

#+BEGIN_CENTER
This text will be centered when exported.

Multiple paragraphs can be centered together.
#+END_CENTER

** ✅ Source Blocks
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:49]

For code with syntax highlighting (covered in detail in [[file:07-source-blocks.org][Source Blocks]]):

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def hello(name):
    """Greet someone by name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
#+END_SRC

** ✅ Comment Blocks
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:49]

For content that should not appear in exports:

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
TODO: Add more examples here before publishing.
This entire block is hidden from exported output.
#+END_COMMENT

* ✅ Comments
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:49]

Individual lines can be commented out:

# This line is a comment and won't export
Regular text continues here.

Everything after =# = at the start of a line is hidden from export but visible in the source.

For inline comments that span part of a line, there's no direct syntax—use comment blocks or restructure your content.

* ✅ Special Characters
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:49]

** ✅ Entities
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:49]

Org-mode supports named entities for special characters:

- =\alpha= → α, =\beta= → β, =\gamma= → γ (Greek letters)
- =\rarr= → →, =\larr= → ←, =\harr= → ↔ (arrows)
- =\deg= → °, =\pm= → ±, =\times= → × (symbols)
- =\copy= → ©, =\reg= → ®, =\trade= → ™ (legal)

@@>VS Code does not render the entities like Emacs does.<@@

** ✅ Escaping Markup
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 17:49]

To show literal markup characters without triggering formatting:

- Use a zero-width space (not practical)
- Use =verbatim= or =code= markup: the asterisk =*= creates bold
- Use an example block for longer passages

In source blocks and example blocks, all markup is automatically literal.
