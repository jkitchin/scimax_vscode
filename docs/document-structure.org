*Keybinding Note:* This extension uses Emacs-style keybindings where Ctrl is used on all platforms (not Cmd on Mac), except where explicitly noted. Mac alternatives are shown as Cmd where applicable.

* ⚠️ Document Structure

Org documents are structured around *headlines*, which create a hierarchical
outline that can be folded, navigated, and manipulated. This chapter covers how
to create and work with document structure in Scimax VS Code.

* ⚠️ Headlines

Headlines are the backbone of org documents. They define the structure and allow
for powerful outline-based navigation and organization.

** ⚠️ Creating Headlines

A headline starts with one or more asterisks (*) at the beginning of a line,
followed by a space:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Top Level Headline
,** Second Level
,*** Third Level
,**** Fourth Level
#+END_SRC

There is no hard limit on headline levels, but most documents use 3-5 levels.

** ⚠️ Headline Components

A headline can contain several components:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO [#A] Headline Title                                    :tag1:tag2:
#+END_SRC

| Component     | Description                         | Example        |
|---------------+-------------------------------------+----------------|
| Stars         | Define the level (required)         | *, **, *** |
| TODO keyword  | Task state (optional)               | TODO, DONE   |
| Priority      | Importance marker (optional)        | [#A], [#B]   |
| Title         | The headline text (required)        | Any text       |
| Tags          | Categorization labels (optional)    | :work:urgent: |

** ⚠️ Headline Levels

Headlines can be nested to any depth:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Level 1: Main Section
,** Level 2: Subsection
,*** Level 3: Sub-subsection
,**** Level 4: Paragraph grouping
,***** Level 5: Fine detail
#+END_SRC

Use consistent levels throughout your document. Skipping levels (e.g., going
from * to ***) works but may cause confusion.

* ⚠️ Visibility Cycling

One of the most powerful features of org documents is the ability to fold
(collapse) and unfold (expand) sections to manage complexity.

** ⚠️ Folding with Tab

Press Tab on a headline to cycle through visibility states:

| State    | Shows                                    |
|----------+------------------------------------------|
| Folded   | Only the headline, children hidden       |
| Children | Headline and immediate child headlines   |
| Subtree  | All content under this headline          |

Example cycle:
1. * Heading... (folded - ellipsis shows hidden content)
2. * Heading with child headlines visible
3. * Heading with all content visible

** ⚠️ Global Cycling with Shift-Tab

Press Shift+Tab anywhere in the document to cycle global visibility:

| State    | Shows                                    |
|----------+------------------------------------------|
| Overview | Only top-level headlines                 |
| Contents | All headlines at all levels              |
| Show All | Everything expanded                      |

** ⚠️ Visibility Commands

| Key              | Command                              |
|------------------+--------------------------------------|
| Tab             | Cycle visibility at current heading  |
| Shift+Tab       | Cycle global visibility              |

Additional visibility can be controlled through speed commands (see [[file:speed-commands.org][Speed Commands]]):

| Speed Key | Action                               |
|-----------+--------------------------------------|
| c        | Cycle visibility                     |
| Shift+C  | Show children                        |
| o        | Overview (fold all)                  |

* ⚠️ Motion Between Headlines

Efficient navigation between headlines is essential for working with large
documents.

** ⚠️ Navigation Commands

| Key                    | Command                          |
|------------------------+----------------------------------|
| Ctrl+C Ctrl+J         | Jump to any heading (with menu)  |
| Next/Previous heading  | Built-in VS Code outline         |

** ⚠️ Using the Outline View

The VS Code Outline view provides visual navigation:

1. Open the Outline view (sidebar or Ctrl+Shift+O)
2. Click any heading to jump to it
3. Use the filter box to search headings

** ⚠️ Jump to Heading

Press Ctrl+C Ctrl+J to open a quick-pick menu of all headings. Type to filter
and press Enter to jump.

** ⚠️ Speed Command Navigation

With speed commands enabled (scimax.speedCommands.enabled: true), when your
cursor is at the beginning of a headline, single keys navigate:

| Key | Action                                 |
|-----+----------------------------------------|
| n  | Next heading (any level)               |
| p  | Previous heading (any level)           |
| f  | Next heading (same level - forward)    |
| b  | Previous heading (same level - back)   |
| u  | Up to parent heading                   |
| j  | Jump to heading (opens menu)           |
| g  | Go to... (opens navigation menu)       |

* ⚠️ Structure Editing

Scimax VS Code provides commands to restructure your document without
manual cut-and-paste.

** ⚠️ Promote/Demote Headlines

Change the level of a headline:

| Key           | Command                              |
|---------------+--------------------------------------|
| Alt+Left     | Promote heading (decrease level)     |
| Alt+Right    | Demote heading (increase level)      |
| Alt+Shift+Left  | Promote subtree                   |
| Alt+Shift+Right | Demote subtree                    |

*Promote* means moving toward the root (** -> *).
*Demote* means moving away from the root (* -> **).

*** ⚠️ Single Heading vs Subtree

- *Promote/Demote Heading*: Changes only the current headline's level
- *Promote/Demote Subtree*: Changes the headline AND all its children

Example - promoting a subtree:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,** Parent                    * Parent
,*** Child 1          ->       ** Child 1
,*** Child 2                  ** Child 2
#+END_SRC

** ⚠️ Move Subtrees Up/Down

Reorder sections without changing their level:

| Key         | Command                              |
|-------------+--------------------------------------|
| Alt+Up     | Move subtree up (swap with previous) |
| Alt+Down   | Move subtree down (swap with next)   |

The entire subtree (heading and all its content/children) moves together.

** ⚠️ Kill/Clone Subtrees

| Command                    | Description                        |
|----------------------------+------------------------------------|
| scimax.org.killSubtree    | Cut the current subtree            |
| scimax.org.cloneSubtree   | Duplicate the current subtree      |

Speed command keys (at heading start):
| Key      | Action                               |
|----------+--------------------------------------|
| w       | Kill (cut) subtree                   |
| Shift+W | Clone (duplicate) subtree            |
| y       | Yank (paste) subtree                 |

** ⚠️ Insert New Headings

| Key           | Command                              |
|---------------+--------------------------------------|
| Ctrl+Enter   | Insert heading at same level         |

The command scimax.org.insertHeading inserts a new heading. The behavior
depends on context:

- On a heading line: Insert new heading at same level
- In body text: Insert new heading after current section

For subheadings:
| Command                       | Description                      |
|-------------------------------+----------------------------------|
| scimax.org.insertSubheading  | Insert heading one level deeper  |

* ⚠️ Document Keywords

Document keywords appear at the beginning of the file and configure
document-wide settings.

** ⚠️ Common Keywords

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+TITLE: Document Title
,#+AUTHOR: Author Name
,#+DATE: 2026-01-13
,#+EMAIL: author@example.com
#+END_SRC

** ⚠️ Options Keyword

The #+OPTIONS: keyword controls export and display behavior:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+OPTIONS: toc:2 num:t H:4 ^:nil
#+END_SRC

| Option  | Values          | Description                      |
|---------+-----------------+----------------------------------|
| toc    | t, nil, number | Table of contents depth          |
| num    | t, nil         | Section numbering                |
| H      | number          | Headline levels for export       |
| ^      | t, nil, {}    | Subscript/superscript handling   |
| author | t, nil         | Include author in export         |
| date   | t, nil         | Include date in export           |

** ⚠️ Startup Keyword

Control initial visibility:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+STARTUP: overview    # Start with all headings folded
,#+STARTUP: content     # Show all headings, hide body
,#+STARTUP: showall     # Show everything
#+END_SRC

** ⚠️ Property Keyword

Set default properties for source blocks:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+PROPERTY: header-args :exports both
,#+PROPERTY: header-args:python :session *python*
#+END_SRC

* ⚠️ Properties Drawers

Properties drawers store metadata about a headline in key-value pairs.

** ⚠️ Creating Properties Drawers

Properties appear in a :PROPERTIES: drawer immediately after the headline:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* My Headline
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: my-headline
:CATEGORY: work
:EFFORT: 2:00
:END:
#+END_SRC

** ⚠️ Special Properties

Certain properties have special meaning:

| Property    | Description                              |
|-------------+------------------------------------------|
| ID         | Globally unique identifier (UUID)        |
| CUSTOM_ID  | Document-unique identifier for linking   |
| CATEGORY   | Category for agenda views                |
| EFFORT     | Estimated time (H:MM format)             |
| COLUMNS    | Column view format specification         |
| VISIBILITY | Initial visibility (folded, children, all)|

** ⚠️ Adding Properties

To add a property via speed commands, press Shift+P at a heading start.

You can also add properties manually by typing inside the drawer.

** ⚠️ Inherited Properties

Some properties are inherited by child headlines. The CATEGORY property, for
example, applies to all children unless overridden.

* ⚠️ Drawers

Drawers are collapsible sections that hide auxiliary information.

** ⚠️ Standard Drawers

*** ⚠️ PROPERTIES Drawer

Stores headline metadata (see above).

*** ⚠️ LOGBOOK Drawer

Stores clock entries and state change history:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO My Task
:LOGBOOK:
CLOCK: [2026-01-13 Mon 09:00]--[2026-01-13 Mon 10:30] =>  1:30
- State "TODO"       from "WAITING"    [2026-01-12 Sun 14:00]
:END:
#+END_SRC

** ⚠️ Custom Drawers

Create custom drawers for any purpose:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Research Notes
:NOTES:
These are private notes that won't be exported.
- Reference: Smith et al. 2024
- Follow up with collaborator
:END:

:REFERENCES:
- [[cite:smith-2024]]
- [[cite:jones-2023]]
:END:
#+END_SRC

Drawer names must be uppercase letters and can contain numbers and underscores.

** ⚠️ Drawer Visibility

Drawers are typically displayed collapsed. Click or use fold commands to
expand/collapse them.

* ⚠️ Inline Tasks

Inline tasks are special headlines at a very deep level (default: 15 stars or
more) that are treated as inline content within a section rather than as
document structure.

** ⚠️ Creating Inline Tasks

An inline task uses many stars (15+) and has a matching END marker:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Main Headline
Content of the headline.

,*************** TODO Quick inline task
This is an inline task that doesn't affect document structure.
It's useful for small, self-contained TODOs within prose.
,*************** END

More content continues here.
#+END_SRC

** ⚠️ Inline Task Features

Inline tasks support the same features as regular headlines:

| Feature     | Example                                      |
|-------------+----------------------------------------------|
| TODO state  | *************** TODO Task                   |
| Priority    | *************** [#A] High priority          |
| Tags        | *************** Task :urgent:work:          |
| Body text   | Content between task and END                 |

** ⚠️ When to Use Inline Tasks

- Quick TODOs embedded in documentation
- Small tasks that don't warrant their own section
- Notes or reminders within prose
- Tasks that shouldn't appear in document outline

** ⚠️ Configuration

The minimum headline level for inline tasks is configurable. By default,
headlines with 15 or more stars are treated as inline tasks.

* ⚠️ Footnote Definitions

Footnotes allow you to add supplementary information without interrupting
the main text flow.

** ⚠️ Footnote Definition Syntax

Footnotes are defined with [fn:LABEL] at the start of a line:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
This paragraph has a footnote reference[fn:1].

[fn:1] This is the footnote content. It can span
  multiple lines if subsequent lines are indented.

Another paragraph continues here.
#+END_SRC

** ⚠️ Footnote Labels

Footnotes can use numeric or named labels:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
See the paper for details[fn:1].
This is a key concept[fn:important-note].

[fn:1] Smith et al., 2024.
[fn:important-note] A named footnote for easy reference.
#+END_SRC

** ⚠️ Multi-line Footnotes

Footnote definitions can span multiple lines with indentation:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
[fn:long-note] This is a longer footnote that spans
  multiple lines. All continuation lines must be
  indented to be included in the footnote.

  You can even have multiple paragraphs by leaving
  a blank line with proper indentation.
#+END_SRC

** ⚠️ Inline Footnotes

For short footnotes, use inline syntax:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
This has an inline footnote[fn:: This is the definition].
#+END_SRC

** ⚠️ Related Topics

See [[file:links.org][Links]] for information on footnote references.

* ⚠️ Dynamic Blocks

Dynamic blocks are special regions whose content is generated programmatically.
They are defined with #+BEGIN: and #+END: markers.

** ⚠️ Dynamic Block Syntax

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+BEGIN: block-name parameters
Content that will be replaced when block is updated.
,#+END:
#+END_SRC

** ⚠️ Clock Table Example

The most common dynamic block is the clock table, which summarizes time spent:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :scope file
| Headline          | Time   |
|-------------------+--------|
| * Project work    |  10:30 |
| ** Implementation |   6:00 |
| ** Testing        |   4:30 |
,#+END:
#+END_SRC

** ⚠️ Column View Example

Column view displays properties in a table format:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id global
| ITEM         | EFFORT | PRIORITY |
|--------------+--------+----------|
| Task 1       | 2:00   | A        |
| Task 2       | 1:30   | B        |
,#+END:
#+END_SRC

** ⚠️ Dynamic Block Parameters

Common parameters for clock tables:

| Parameter   | Description                           | Example         |
|-------------+---------------------------------------+-----------------|
| :maxlevel  | Maximum headline depth                | :maxlevel 3    |
| :scope     | Scope of clock data                   | :scope file    |
| :tstart    | Start time for report                 | :tstart "<-1w>" |
| :tend      | End time for report                   | :tend "<now>"  |
| :block     | Time block (today, thisweek, etc.)    | :block thisweek |

** ⚠️ Updating Dynamic Blocks

Dynamic blocks are updated when explicitly requested. The content between
#+BEGIN: and #+END: is regenerated based on the block type and parameters.

* ⚠️ Best Practices

** ⚠️ Document Organization

1. *Start with an outline* - Create your heading structure before adding content
2. *Use consistent levels* - Don't skip levels arbitrarily
3. *Keep headings concise* - Use brief, descriptive titles
4. *Use tags for cross-cutting concerns* - Don't rely solely on hierarchy

** ⚠️ Heading Depth Guidelines

| Level | Typical Use                              |
|-------+------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Major sections/chapters                  |
| 2     | Subsections                              |
| 3     | Topics within subsections                |
| 4     | Detailed points                          |
| 5+    | Rarely needed; consider restructuring    |

** ⚠️ Navigation Efficiency

1. *Use Ctrl+C Ctrl+J* for direct jumps to any heading
2. *Use outline view* for visual navigation in long documents
3. *Enable speed commands* for rapid single-key navigation
4. *Use Shift+Tab* to get an overview before diving in
