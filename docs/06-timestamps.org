*Keybinding Note:* This extension uses Emacs-style keybindings where Ctrl is used on all platforms (not Cmd on Mac), except where explicitly noted. Mac alternatives are shown as Cmd where applicable.

* ✅ Timestamps
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:57]

Timestamps in Scimax VS Code allow you to associate dates and times with your
content. They are essential for scheduling tasks, tracking deadlines, recording
events, and managing time.

* ✅ Timestamp Types
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:57]

Org-mode supports two types of timestamps that serve different purposes.

** ✅ Active Timestamps
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:57]

Active timestamps appear in the agenda and are used for scheduling and events:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
<2026-01-15 Wed>
<2026-01-15 Wed 14:30>
#+END_SRC

Active timestamps use angle brackets <...> and will:
- Appear in agenda views
- Show up in deadline warnings
- Be included in time-based searches
- Trigger reminders

** ✅ Inactive Timestamps
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:57]

Inactive timestamps are for recording when something happened without agenda
visibility:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
[2026-01-15 Wed]
[2026-01-15 Wed 14:30]
#+END_SRC

Inactive timestamps use square brackets [...] and will:
- NOT appear in the agenda
- Be used for logging (CLOSED, state changes)
- Record historical information
- Document when notes were taken

** ✅ When to Use Each Type
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:57]

| Use Case                     | Type     | Example                         |
|------------------------------+----------+---------------------------------|
| Schedule a task              | Active   | SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed>     |
| Set a deadline               | Active   | DEADLINE: <2026-01-20 Mon>      |
| Record appointment           | Active   | <2026-01-18 Thu 14:00>          |
| Log completion time          | Inactive | CLOSED: [2026-01-14 Tue 10:30]  |
| Document when note was added | Inactive | [2026-01-14 Tue] Added notes... |
| Track state change           | Inactive | State "DONE" from "TODO" [...]  |

* ✅ Date and Time Formats
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

** ✅ Basic Date Format
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

The standard date format is YYYY-MM-DD Day:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
<2026-01-15 Wed>
[2026-12-31 Thu]
#+END_SRC

The day of week is automatically calculated and included.

** ✅ Date with Time
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

Add time in 24-hour HH:MM format:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
<2026-01-15 Wed 09:00>
<2026-01-15 Wed 14:30>
<2026-01-15 Wed 23:59>
#+END_SRC

** ✅ Time Only
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

You can specify just a time (assumes today):

#+BEGIN_SRC org
<14:30>
#+END_SRC

CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

** ✅ Date Ranges
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

Specify a range of dates with --:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
<2026-01-15 Wed>--<2026-01-17 Fri>
#+END_SRC

This represents an event spanning multiple days, like a conference.

** ✅ Time Ranges
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

Specify a time range within a single day:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
<2026-01-15 Wed 09:00-17:00>

* ✅ Modifying Timestamps
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:03]

** ✅ Adjusting Dates with Keyboard
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:03]

Place cursor on a timestamp component and use:

| Key         | Action                            |
|-------------+-----------------------------------|
| S-<up>    | Increase value (day, month, year) |
| S-<down>  | Decrease value                    |
| S-<right> | Move to next day                  |
| S-<left>  | Move to previous day              |

** ✅ Component-Based Editing
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:03]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<2026-01-15 Wed 14:30>
 ↑    ↑  ↑   ↑   ↑  ↑
 Year │  Day │   Hour │
      Month  │   Minute
            Day of week (read-only)
#+END_EXAMPLE

* ✅ Repeating Timestamps
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:04]

Repeaters make timestamps recur automatically, perfect for recurring tasks and
events.

** ✅ Basic Repeater Syntax
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:04]

Add a repeater after the date: +Nx where:
- + is the repeater marker
- N is a number
- x is the unit (d, w, m, y)

#+BEGIN_SRC org
<2026-01-15 Wed +1w>     ; Repeats weekly
<2026-01-15 Wed +2d>     ; Repeats every 2 days
<2026-01-01 Thu +1m>     ; Repeats monthly
<2026-01-15 Wed +1y>     ; Repeats yearly
#+END_SRC

** ✅ Repeater Units
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:04]

| Unit | Meaning  | Example | Next Occurrence      |
|------+----------+---------+----------------------|
| d    | Day(s)   | +1d     | Tomorrow             |
| w    | Week(s)  | +1w     | Same day next week   |
| m    | Month(s) | +1m     | Same date next month |
| y    | Year(s)  | +1y     | Same date next year  |
| h    | Hour(s)  | +2h     | Two hours later      |

** ✅ Repeater Behavior
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 08:40]

When you mark a repeating task as DONE:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Weekly review
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed +1w>

; After marking DONE:

,* TODO Weekly review
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-22 Wed +1w>
#+END_SRC

The task automatically returns to TODO state with the next occurrence date.

** ✅ Repeater Type Modifiers
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:04]

Three types of repeaters handle different scenarios:

*** ✅ Standard Repeater (+)
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:04]

Shifts from the original base date:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Staff meeting
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed +1w>
#+END_SRC

If you complete it late (on Jan 20), it still schedules to Jan 22 (one week
from original date).

*** ✅ Catch-up Repeater (++)
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:04]

Shifts from the completion date:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Exercise
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed ++1d>
#+END_SRC

If you complete it late (on Jan 17), it schedules to Jan 18 (one day from
when you completed it).

*** ✅ Restart Repeater (.+)
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 08:40]

For tasks that must happen a fixed interval after completion:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Water plants
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed .+3d>
#+END_SRC

If you complete it on Jan 18, it schedules to Jan 21 (exactly 3 days later).

** ✅ Repeater Comparison
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 08:40]

| Type     | Symbol | Schedules from  | Use Case                     |

* ✅ Diary Sexp Timestamps
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 19:49]

Diary sexps (symbolic expressions) are a powerful feature for specifying
complex date patterns that can't be expressed with simple repeaters.

** ✅ Diary Sexp Syntax
CLOSED: [2026-01-18 Sun 12:53]

Diary sexps use the %%( ) syntax, optionally within angle brackets:

  %%(diary-anniversary 1 20 1990) John's Birthday   
#+BEGIN_SRC org
%%(diary-anniversary 1 15 1990)
<%%((diary-float t 1 2))>

* ✅ Timestamp Best Practices
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 20:44]

** ✅ When to Use Active vs Inactive
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 20:44]

*Use active timestamps when:*
- Scheduling tasks to work on
- Setting deadlines
- Planning appointments or events
- You want it to appear in the agenda

*Use inactive timestamps when:*
- Recording when something happened
- Documenting note-taking time
- Logging state changes
- You DON'T want it in the agenda

** ✅ Choosing Repeater Types
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 20:44]

| Scenario                        | Repeater Type | Example                    |
|---------------------------------+---------------+----------------------------|
| Fixed appointment               | +            | Team meeting every Monday  |
| Daily habit                     | ++           | Morning exercise           |
| Maintenance after completion    | .+           | Change oil 90 days after   |
| Regular review                  | +            | Monthly report last Friday |
| Medication                      | ++           | Take daily after waking    |

** ✅ Time Tracking Tips
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 20:44]

1. *Clock in when starting* - Build the habit immediately
2. *Clock out when stopping* - Even for short breaks
3. *Review clock reports* - Weekly time analysis
4. *Compare estimate vs actual* - Improve future estimates
5. *Use LOGBOOK for notes* - Document blockers or issues
