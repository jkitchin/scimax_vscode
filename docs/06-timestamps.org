*Keybinding Note:* This extension uses Emacs-style keybindings where Ctrl is used on all platforms (not Cmd on Mac), except where explicitly noted. Mac alternatives are shown as Cmd where applicable.

* ✅ Timestamps
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:57]

Timestamps in Scimax VS Code allow you to associate dates and times with your
content. They are essential for scheduling tasks, tracking deadlines, recording
events, and managing time.

* ✅ Timestamp Types
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:57]

Org-mode supports two types of timestamps that serve different purposes.

** ✅ Active Timestamps
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:57]

Active timestamps appear in the agenda and are used for scheduling and events:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
<2026-01-15 Wed>
<2026-01-15 Wed 14:30>
#+END_SRC

Active timestamps use angle brackets <...> and will:
- Appear in agenda views
- Show up in deadline warnings
- Be included in time-based searches
- Trigger reminders

** ✅ Inactive Timestamps
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:57]

Inactive timestamps are for recording when something happened without agenda
visibility:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
[2026-01-15 Wed]
[2026-01-15 Wed 14:30]
#+END_SRC

Inactive timestamps use square brackets [...] and will:
- NOT appear in the agenda
- Be used for logging (CLOSED, state changes)
- Record historical information
- Document when notes were taken

** ✅ When to Use Each Type
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:57]

| Use Case                     | Type     | Example                         |
|------------------------------+----------+---------------------------------|
| Schedule a task              | Active   | SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed>     |
| Set a deadline               | Active   | DEADLINE: <2026-01-20 Mon>      |
| Record appointment           | Active   | <2026-01-18 Thu 14:00>          |
| Log completion time          | Inactive | CLOSED: [2026-01-14 Tue 10:30]  |
| Document when note was added | Inactive | [2026-01-14 Tue] Added notes... |
| Track state change           | Inactive | State "DONE" from "TODO" [...]  |

* ✅ Date and Time Formats
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

** ✅ Basic Date Format
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

The standard date format is YYYY-MM-DD Day:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
<2026-01-15 Wed>
[2026-12-31 Thu]
#+END_SRC

The day of week is automatically calculated and included.

** ✅ Date with Time
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

Add time in 24-hour HH:MM format:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
<2026-01-15 Wed 09:00>
<2026-01-15 Wed 14:30>
<2026-01-15 Wed 23:59>
#+END_SRC

** ✅ Time Only
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

You can specify just a time (assumes today):

#+BEGIN_SRC org
<14:30>
#+END_SRC

** ✅ Supported Date Components
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

| Component   | Format | Example | Description               |
|-------------+--------+---------+---------------------------|
| Year        | YYYY   | 2026    | Four-digit year           |
| Month       | MM     | 01      | Two-digit month (01-12)   |
| Day         | DD     | 15      | Two-digit day (01-31)     |
| Day of week | Day    | Wed     | Three-letter abbreviation |
| Hour        | HH     | 14      | Two-digit hour (00-23)    |
| Minute      | MM     | 30      | Two-digit minute (00-59)  |

* ✅ Date and Time Ranges
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

** ✅ Date Ranges
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

Specify a range of dates with --:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
<2026-01-15 Wed>--<2026-01-17 Fri>
#+END_SRC

This represents an event spanning multiple days, like a conference.

** ✅ Time Ranges
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

Specify a time range within a single day:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
<2026-01-15 Wed 09:00-17:00>
#+END_SRC

This is useful for meetings or work sessions with defined start and end times.

** ✅ Time Range Examples
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Meeting with client
<2026-01-15 Wed 14:00-15:30>

,* Conference attendance
<2026-03-10 Mon>--<2026-03-12 Wed>

,* Office hours
<2026-01-15 Wed 10:00-12:00>
#+END_SRC

* ✅ Creating Timestamps
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:58]

** 👀 Insert Timestamp Command

| Key/Command | Action                        |
|-------------+-------------------------------|
| C-c .    | Insert active timestamp       |
| C-c !    | Insert inactive timestamp     |
| Speed key . | Insert timestamp (at heading) |

Press C-c . and a date picker dialog appears. You can:
1. Type a date directly (2026-01-15)
2. Use relative expressions (+2d, next week)
3. Navigate with arrow keys
4. Press Enter to confirm

** ⚠️ Date Entry Shortcuts

When entering a date, use these expressions:

| Expression | Result                          |
|------------+---------------------------------|
| +2d        | Two days from now               |
| -1w        | One week ago                    |
| +3m        | Three months from now           |
| today      | Today's date                    |
| tomorrow   | Tomorrow's date                 |
| monday     | Next Monday                     |
| jan 15     | January 15 of current/next year |
| 2026-01-15 | Specific date                   |

** ⚠️ Adding Time to Timestamps

When prompted for a date, add time after the date:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
2026-01-15 14:30
#+END_EXAMPLE

Or use 12-hour format with am/pm:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
2026-01-15 2:30pm
#+END_EXAMPLE

** ⚠️ Quick Timestamp Insertion

For common cases:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Task
  <2026-01-15 Wed>         ; Press C-c .

,* Meeting notes
  [2026-01-14 Tue 10:00]   ; Press C-c !
#+END_SRC

* ✅ Modifying Timestamps
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:03]

** ✅ Adjusting Dates with Keyboard
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:03]

Place cursor on a timestamp component and use:

| Key         | Action                            |
|-------------+-----------------------------------|
| S-<up>    | Increase value (day, month, year) |
| S-<down>  | Decrease value                    |
| S-<right> | Move to next day                  |
| S-<left>  | Move to previous day              |

** ✅ Component-Based Editing
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:03]

The cursor position determines what changes:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<2026-01-15 Wed 14:30>
 ↑    ↑  ↑   ↑   ↑  ↑
 Year │  Day │   Hour │
      Month  │   Minute
            Day of week (read-only)
#+END_EXAMPLE

- On year: S-<up>/Down changes year
- On month: S-<up>/Down changes month
- On day: S-<up>/Down or S-<left>/Right changes day
- On hour: S-<up>/Down changes hour
- On minute: S-<up>/Down changes minute

** ✅ Quick Date Adjustment Examples
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:03]

#+BEGIN_SRC org
; Move meeting to tomorrow
<2026-01-15 Wed 14:30>
; Place cursor anywhere in date, press S-<right>
<2026-01-16 Thu 14:30>

; Postpone by one month
<2026-01-15 Wed>
; Place cursor on month (01), press S-<up>
<2026-02-15 Sat>
#+END_SRC

** ✅ Editing Timestamp Dialog
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:03]

Press C-c . on an existing timestamp to open the editor and:
- Modify the date
- Add or remove time
- Change between active/inactive
- Add repeaters or warnings

* ✅ Repeating Timestamps
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:04]

Repeaters make timestamps recur automatically, perfect for recurring tasks and
events.

** ✅ Basic Repeater Syntax
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:04]

Add a repeater after the date: +Nx where:
- + is the repeater marker
- N is a number
- x is the unit (d, w, m, y)

#+BEGIN_SRC org
<2026-01-15 Wed +1w>     ; Repeats weekly
<2026-01-15 Wed +2d>     ; Repeats every 2 days
<2026-01-01 Thu +1m>     ; Repeats monthly
<2026-01-15 Wed +1y>     ; Repeats yearly
#+END_SRC

** ✅ Repeater Units
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:04]

| Unit | Meaning  | Example | Next Occurrence      |
|------+----------+---------+----------------------|
| d    | Day(s)   | +1d     | Tomorrow             |
| w    | Week(s)  | +1w     | Same day next week   |
| m    | Month(s) | +1m     | Same date next month |
| y    | Year(s)  | +1y     | Same date next year  |
| h    | Hour(s)  | +2h     | Two hours later      |

** ⚠️ Repeater Behavior

When you mark a repeating task as DONE:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Weekly review
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed +1w>

; After marking DONE:

,* TODO Weekly review
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-22 Wed +1w>
#+END_SRC

The task automatically returns to TODO state with the next occurrence date.

** ✅ Repeater Type Modifiers
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:04]

Three types of repeaters handle different scenarios:

*** ✅ Standard Repeater (+)
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:04]

Shifts from the original base date:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Staff meeting
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed +1w>
#+END_SRC

If you complete it late (on Jan 20), it still schedules to Jan 22 (one week
from original date).

*** ✅ Catch-up Repeater (++)
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:04]

Shifts from the completion date:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Exercise
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed ++1d>
#+END_SRC

If you complete it late (on Jan 17), it schedules to Jan 18 (one day from
when you completed it).

*** ⚠️ Restart Repeater (.+)

For tasks that must happen a fixed interval after completion:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Water plants
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed .+3d>
#+END_SRC

If you complete it on Jan 18, it schedules to Jan 21 (exactly 3 days later).

** ⚠️ Repeater Comparison

| Type     | Symbol | Schedules from  | Use Case                     |
|----------+--------+-----------------+------------------------------|
| Standard | +      | Original date   | Fixed appointments, meetings |
| Catch-up | ++     | Completion date | Habits, daily tasks          |
| Restart  | .+     | Completion date | Maintenance, periodic tasks  |

** ⚠️ Repeater Examples

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Daily standup meeting
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed 09:00 +1d>
; Every workday at 9am

,* TODO Monthly report
DEADLINE: <2026-01-31 Fri +1m>
; Due last day of each month

,* TODO Backup server
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed ++1w>
; Weekly, but adjust if done late

,* TODO Change air filter
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed .+90d>
; Every 90 days after actually changing it

,* TODO Practice guitar
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed ++1d>
; Daily practice, catch up if missed
#+END_SRC

* ✅ SCHEDULED and DEADLINE
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:05]

Two special keywords attach timestamps to TODO items for planning.

** ✅ SCHEDULED Keyword
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:05]

Indicates when you plan to START working on a task:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Write documentation
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed>
#+END_SRC

** ✅ DEADLINE Keyword
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:05]

Indicates when a task must be COMPLETED by:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Submit proposal
DEADLINE: <2026-01-20 Mon>
#+END_SRC

** ✅ Using Both Together
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:05]

Tasks can have both:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Complete quarterly report
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed>
DEADLINE: <2026-01-25 Sat>
#+END_SRC

Start working on Jan 15, must finish by Jan 25.

** ✅ Adding SCHEDULED and DEADLINE
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:05]

| Key/Command         | Action             |
|---------------------+--------------------|
| Speed key s         | Add/edit SCHEDULED |
| Speed key d         | Add/edit DEADLINE  |
| scimax.org.schedule | Schedule task      |
| scimax.org.deadline | Set deadline       |

Position cursor on a TODO headline and press s or d (with speed commands
enabled).

** ✅ SCHEDULED vs DEADLINE
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 15:05]

| Aspect      | SCHEDULED                      | DEADLINE                    |
|-------------+--------------------------------+-----------------------------|
| Meaning     | When to START                  | When to FINISH              |
| Agenda      | Shows starting this day        | Shows with warnings         |
| Past dates  | Appears every day until done   | Shows days overdue          |
| Use for     | Planning, time-blocking        | Hard deadlines, due dates   |

** ⚠️ Examples with Context

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Review contract
SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed>
DEADLINE: <2026-01-17 Fri>
Need to finish before weekend.

,* TODO Weekly team meeting
SCHEDULED: <2026-02-13 Fri 10:00 +1w>
Recurring Thursday meeting.

,* TODO File taxes
DEADLINE: <2026-04-15 Tue -7d>
Due April 15, start warning 7 days early.
#+END_SRC

* ⚠️ Warning Periods

Warning periods display deadlines in the agenda before they're due.

** ⚠️ Warning Period Syntax

Add -Nd to a deadline where N is days:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
DEADLINE: <2026-01-25 Sat -7d>
#+END_SRC

This appears in the agenda 7 days before January 25.

** ⚠️ Default Warning Period

Without a warning period specified, deadlines show 14 days in advance.

** ⚠️ Setting Custom Warnings

| Warning   | Meaning                             |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| -3d      | Warn 3 days before                  |
| -1w      | Warn 1 week before                  |
| -2w      | Warn 2 weeks before                 |
| -1m      | Warn 1 month before                 |
| -0d      | Show only on deadline day           |

** ⚠️ Warning Period Examples

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Renew driver's license
DEADLINE: <2026-06-30 Tue -30d>
; Start warning 30 days early

,* TODO Submit conference paper
DEADLINE: <2026-02-15 Sun -14d>
; Two week warning

,* TODO Pay rent
DEADLINE: <2026-02-01 Sun -0d>
; Show only on the day it's due

,* TODO Annual review meeting
SCHEDULED: <2026-12-15 Tue -7d>
; Even SCHEDULED can have warnings for preparation
#+END_SRC

** ⚠️ Combining Repeaters and Warnings

You can use both repeaters and warnings:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Monthly expense report
DEADLINE: <2026-01-31 Fri +1m -3d>
; Due monthly, warn 3 days before
#+END_SRC

* ⚠️ Time Clocking

Track how much time you spend on tasks with clock entries.

** ⚠️ Clocking In and Out

Start and stop the clock for a task:

| Key/Command             | Action                            |
|-------------------------+-----------------------------------|
| Speed key I      | Clock in (start timer)            |
| Speed key O      | Clock out (stop timer)            |
| scimax.org.clockIn     | Clock in via command              |
| scimax.org.clockOut    | Clock out via command             |

** ⚠️ Clock Entry Format

Clock entries are stored in the LOGBOOK drawer:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Write documentation
:LOGBOOK:
CLOCK: [2026-01-14 Tue 09:00]--[2026-01-14 Tue 10:30] =>  1:30
CLOCK: [2026-01-13 Mon 14:00]--[2026-01-13 Mon 16:00] =>  2:00
:END:
#+END_SRC

Format: CLOCK: [start]--[end] => duration

** ⚠️ Active Clock

When clocked in, the current clock has no end time:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Working on feature implementation
:LOGBOOK:
CLOCK: [2026-01-14 Tue 14:00]
CLOCK: [2026-01-14 Tue 09:00]--[2026-01-14 Tue 12:00] =>  3:00
:END:
#+END_SRC

The CLOCK: [2026-01-14 Tue 14:00] entry is the currently running clock.

** ⚠️ Clock Workflow Example

1. Start working:
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
   ,* TODO Implement login feature
   :LOGBOOK:
   CLOCK: [2026-01-14 Tue 09:00]
   :END:
   #+END_SRC

2. Take a break (clock out):
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
   ,* TODO Implement login feature
   :LOGBOOK:
   CLOCK: [2026-01-14 Tue 09:00]--[2026-01-14 Tue 11:00] =>  2:00
   :END:
   #+END_SRC

3. Resume work (clock in again):
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
   ,* TODO Implement login feature
   :LOGBOOK:
   CLOCK: [2026-01-14 Tue 13:00]
   CLOCK: [2026-01-14 Tue 09:00]--[2026-01-14 Tue 11:00] =>  2:00
   :END:
   #+END_SRC

4. Finish (clock out):
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
   ,* TODO Implement login feature
   :LOGBOOK:
   CLOCK: [2026-01-14 Tue 13:00]--[2026-01-14 Tue 15:30] =>  2:30
   CLOCK: [2026-01-14 Tue 09:00]--[2026-01-14 Tue 11:00] =>  2:00
   :END:
   #+END_SRC

Total time: 4:30 (2:00 + 2:30)

** ⚠️ Clock Reports

View time summaries:

| Command                      | Description                     |
|------------------------------+---------------------------------|
| scimax.org.clockReport      | Generate clock report           |
| scimax.agenda.clockReport   | Clock report in agenda          |

** ⚠️ Clock Table

Insert a dynamic table showing time spent:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :scope file
,#+END:
#+END_SRC

This creates a table like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| Headline                  | Time   |
|---------------------------+--------|
| * TODO Project work       |  10:30 |
| ** Implement feature A    |   4:30 |
| ** Bug fixes              |   6:00 |
#+END_EXAMPLE

* ⚠️ The LOGBOOK Drawer

The LOGBOOK drawer stores time-tracking and state-change information.

** ⚠️ LOGBOOK Contents

The LOGBOOK can contain:
1. Clock entries (CLOCK: lines)
2. State change notes
3. Other time-related metadata

** ⚠️ LOGBOOK Example

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* DONE Review pull request
CLOSED: [2026-01-14 Tue 15:00]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2026-01-14 Tue 15:00]
  Approved all changes, ready to merge.
CLOCK: [2026-01-14 Tue 14:00]--[2026-01-14 Tue 15:00] =>  1:00
CLOCK: [2026-01-14 Tue 09:30]--[2026-01-14 Tue 10:00] =>  0:30
- State "TODO"       from "WAITING"    [2026-01-14 Tue 09:00]
  Developer finished addressing comments.
:END:
#+END_SRC

This shows:
- Task completed at 15:00
- State changed from TODO to DONE
- Two work sessions: 1:00 and 0:30
- Previous state change from WAITING to TODO

** ⚠️ LOGBOOK Benefits

1. *Complete history* - See all work on a task
2. *Time accountability* - Track actual time spent
3. *State audit trail* - Understand task progression
4. *Billing records* - For client work time tracking

** ⚠️ Creating LOGBOOK

The LOGBOOK drawer is created automatically when:
- You clock in for the first time
- State change logging is enabled
- You manually add it

Manual LOGBOOK:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Task
:LOGBOOK:
:END:
#+END_SRC

* ⚠️ CLOSED Timestamps

When a task is marked DONE, a CLOSED timestamp is automatically added:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* DONE Complete documentation
CLOSED: [2026-01-14 Tue 16:30]
#+END_SRC

** ⚠️ CLOSED Properties

- Always an inactive timestamp [...]
- Records the exact completion time
- Appears before the task content
- Can be used to calculate completion statistics

* ⚠️ Diary Sexp Timestamps

Diary sexps (symbolic expressions) are a powerful feature for specifying
complex date patterns that can't be expressed with simple repeaters.

** ⚠️ Diary Sexp Syntax

Diary sexps use the %%( ) syntax, optionally within angle brackets:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
%%(diary-anniversary 1 15 1990)
<%%((diary-float t 1 2))>

* ⚠️ Timestamp Best Practices

** ⚠️ When to Use Active vs Inactive

*Use active timestamps when:*
- Scheduling tasks to work on
- Setting deadlines
- Planning appointments or events
- You want it to appear in the agenda

*Use inactive timestamps when:*
- Recording when something happened
- Documenting note-taking time
- Logging state changes
- You DON'T want it in the agenda

** ⚠️ Choosing Repeater Types

| Scenario                        | Repeater Type | Example                    |
|---------------------------------+---------------+----------------------------|
| Fixed appointment               | +            | Team meeting every Monday  |
| Daily habit                     | ++           | Morning exercise           |
| Maintenance after completion    | .+           | Change oil 90 days after   |
| Regular review                  | +            | Monthly report last Friday |
| Medication                      | ++           | Take daily after waking    |

** ⚠️ Time Tracking Tips

1. *Clock in when starting* - Build the habit immediately
2. *Clock out when stopping* - Even for short breaks
3. *Review clock reports* - Weekly time analysis
4. *Compare estimate vs actual* - Improve future estimates
5. *Use LOGBOOK for notes* - Document blockers or issues
