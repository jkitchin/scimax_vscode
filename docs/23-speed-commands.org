*Keybinding Note:* This extension uses Emacs-style keybindings where Ctrl is used on all platforms (not Cmd on Mac), except where explicitly noted. Mac alternatives are shown as Cmd where applicable.

* ✅ Introduction
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:44]

Speed commands are single-letter keyboard shortcuts that work when the cursor is positioned at the very beginning (column 0) of a heading line. This feature, borrowed from Emacs org-mode, provides lightning-fast navigation and editing without the need for complex key chords.

** ✅ What are Speed Commands?
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:44]

Speed commands transform the beginning of each heading into a powerful command interface. When your cursor is at column 0 of a heading (the first star `*' in org-mode or the first hash `#' in markdown), you can press a single key to execute common operations:

- Navigation: jump between headings, siblings, parent
- Visibility: fold/unfold sections
- Structure editing: move, promote, demote, cut, paste
- TODO management: cycle states, set priorities
- Planning: add schedules and deadlines
- Metadata: set tags, properties, effort estimates
- Time tracking: clock in and out
- Archiving: archive completed tasks

This approach is significantly faster than using traditional keybindings or menu commands for frequent operations.

** ✅ Why Use Speed Commands?
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:44]

- *Efficiency*: Single keystrokes instead of multi-key combinations
- *Contextual*: Only active at heading starts, so no conflicts with normal typing
- *Discoverable*: Press `?' at a heading start to see all available commands
- *Emacs-compatible*: Familiar workflow for Emacs org-mode users

* ✅ Configuration

** ✅ Enabling Speed Commands
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:44]

Speed commands are enabled by default in Scimax VS Code. To toggle them on or off:

*** ✅ Via Settings UI
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:44]

1. Open VS Code Settings (C-, or s-, on Mac)
2. Search for "speed commands"
3. Toggle the checkbox for *Scimax: Speed Commands > Enabled*

*** ✅ Via settings.json
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:45]

Add or modify this setting in your `settings.json':

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "scimax.speedCommands.enabled": true
}
#+END_SRC

*** ✅ Via Command Palette
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:45]

1. Open Command Palette (C-S-P or s-S-P on Mac)
2. Type "speed" and select *Scimax: Toggle Speed Commands*

** ✅ Supported File Types
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:45]

Speed commands work in:
- Org-mode files (`.org')
- Markdown files (`.md', `.markdown')

* ✅ When Speed Commands are Active
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:45]

Speed commands are only active when *all* of the following conditions are met:

1. *Speed commands are enabled* in settings (`scimax.speedCommands.enabled: true')
2. *Cursor is at column 0* (the very beginning of the line)
3. *Line is a heading* (starts with `*' for org-mode or `#' for markdown)
4. *No text is selected* (cursor position only, not a selection)

** ✅ Visual Indicator
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:45]

When speed commands are active, you'll notice that single key presses trigger actions immediately. If speed commands aren't working:

1. Check that your cursor is at position 0 (before the first `*' or `#')
2. Ensure no text is selected
3. Verify the file type is org or markdown
4. Check settings to confirm speed commands are enabled

* ✅ Speed Command Reference
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:45]

*** ✅ Structure Editing Notes
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:47]

- *Promote* (left) decreases the heading level (fewer stars/hashes)
- *Demote* (right) increases the heading level (more stars/hashes)
- Lowercase `l'/`r' affect only the heading line
- Uppercase `L'/`R' affect the entire subtree (heading and children)
- `y' (yank) intelligently adjusts heading levels to match context
- `k' kills (cuts) the subtree, matching Emacs scimax
- `w' refiles the subtree, matching Emacs org-mode
- `m' and `@' both mark (select) the subtree

*** ✅ Sorting Entries (^)
CLOSED: [2026-01-27 Tue 18:13]

The `^' speed command sorts child entries of the current heading. When invoked, it presents a menu of sorting criteria:

| Key | Sort Type                          |
|-----+------------------------------------|
| a/A | Alphabetically (A = reverse)       |
| n/N | Numerically (by leading number)    |
| t/T | By timestamp (first in entry)      |
| d/D | By DEADLINE date                   |
| s/S | By SCHEDULED date                  |
| p/P | By priority ([#A], [#B], [#C])     |
| o/O | By TODO keyword order              |
| c/C | By creation time                   |
| k/K | By total clocked time              |
| r/R | By property value (prompts)        |

*Uppercase letters reverse the sort order.*

Sorting scope depends on cursor position:
- On a heading: Sorts direct children of that heading
- With a selection: Sorts entries within the selection
- Before first heading: Sorts all top-level entries

** ✅ TODO and Priority Commands
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:47]

Manage task states and priorities.

| Key | Command           | Description                                  |
|-----+-------------------+----------------------------------------------|
| t   | Cycle TODO state  | Cycle through: (none) → TODO → DONE → (none) |
| ,   | Cycle priority up | Increase priority: C → B → A                 |
| 1   | Priority [#A]     | Set priority to A (highest)                  |
| 2   | Priority [#B]     | Set priority to B (medium)                   |
| 3   | Priority [#C]     | Set priority to C (lowest)                   |
| 0   | Remove priority   | Remove priority marker entirely              |

*** ✅ Priority System
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:47]

Org-mode uses a three-level priority system:
- *[#A]* - High priority (critical, urgent)
- *[#B]* - Medium priority (normal importance)
- *[#C]* - Low priority (nice to have)

Priorities appear after the TODO keyword: `** TODO [#A] Important task'

** ✅ Planning/Timestamp Commands
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:47]

:LOGBOOK:
CLOCK: [2026-01-13 Mon 09:00]--[2026-01-13 Mon 11:30] =>  2:30
CLOCK: [2026-01-12 Fri 14:00]--[2026-01-12 Fri 15:45] =>  1:45
:END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** ✅ Clocking Notes
CLOSED: [2026-01-17 Sat 15:37]

- Only one task can be clocked in at a time
- Clocking in a new task automatically clocks out the previous one
- Clock duration is automatically calculated
- Clock data is used for time reports and agenda views

** ✅ Archive Commands
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

Move completed tasks to archive storage.

| Key | Command              | Description                                     |

| $   | Archive to sibling   | Move subtree under an "Archive" sibling heading |

*** ✅ Archive File
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

By default, `a' moves the subtree to a file named `{basename}_archive.org':
- `notes.org' → `notes_archive.org'
- `projects.org' → `projects_archive.org'

The archived subtree is tagged with `:ARCHIVE:' and includes metadata:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
* DONE Completed project :ARCHIVE:
:PROPERTIES:
:ARCHIVE_TIME: [2026-01-13 Mon 15:30]
:ARCHIVE_FILE: ~/org/projects.org
:END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

* ✅ Tips for Effective Use
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

** ✅ Learning the Commands
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

1. *Start with navigation*: `n', `p', `f', `b', `u' are the most frequently used
2. *Use the help*: Press `?' at any heading start to see all commands
3. *Muscle memory*: The keys are mnemonic:
   - `n' ` next, `p' ' previous, `f' ` forward, `b' ' backward
   - `u' = up (parent)
   - `t' ` TODO, `s' ' schedule, `d' = deadline
   - `I'/`O' = In/Out (clocking)
   - `l'/`r' = left/right (promote/demote)

** ✅ Common Workflows
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

*** ✅ Quick Task Management
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

1. Create heading with `C-<return>'
2. Move to beginning of line (`Home' or `C-a')
3. Press `t' to add TODO state
4. Press `1' to set high priority
5. Press `s' to schedule it
6. Press `:' to add tags

*** ✅ Organizing Content
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

1. Navigate to a heading
2. Use `U'/`D' to reorder siblings
3. Use `l'/`r' to adjust hierarchy
4. Use `k' to cut and `y' to paste sections
5. Use `w' to refile sections to another location
6. Use `^' to sort child entries
7. Use `a' to archive completed work

*** ✅ Reviewing Documents
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

1. Press `o' to see overview (all headings folded)
2. Use `n'/`p' to navigate between sections
3. Press `Tab' to expand interesting sections
4. Press `c' to cycle through visibility levels

** ✅ Combining with Regular Keybindings
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

Speed commands complement (don't replace) regular keybindings:

- Use speed commands for quick operations when cursor is at heading start
- Use regular keybindings (`C-c C-t', etc.) when cursor is elsewhere
- Use `C-a' or `Home' to quickly jump to column 0 to activate speed commands

** ✅ Cursor Position Matters
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

Remember: speed commands *only* work at column 0. If a speed command doesn't trigger:

1. Press `Home' or `C-a' to move to beginning of line
2. Verify you're on a heading line (starts with `*' or `#')
3. Check that no text is selected

** ✅ Customization
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

Currently, speed command keys are pre-defined and cannot be customized. The key mappings follow standard Emacs org-mode conventions for consistency and muscle memory compatibility.

If you need custom keybindings, use VS Code's keybinding system to bind the underlying commands (e.g., `scimax.org.nextHeading', `scimax.org.cycleTodo') to your preferred key combinations.

** ✅ Speed Commands Not Working
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:52]

*Problem*: Pressing keys doesn't trigger speed commands

*Solutions*:
1. Verify cursor is at column 0 (before the `*' or `#')
2. Check file type is `.org' or `.md'
3. Ensure no text is selected
4. Verify speed commands are enabled: `scimax.speedCommands.enabled: true'
5. Restart VS Code after changing settings

** ✅ Wrong Command Executes
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:52]

*Problem*: Different command executes than expected

*Solutions*:
1. Press `?' to see command list and verify key mapping
2. Check for conflicting VS Code keybindings
3. Ensure you're in an org or markdown file
4. Update extension to latest version

** ✅ Help Menu Shows Wrong Commands
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:52]

*Problem*: Help menu (`?') shows outdated information

*Solution*: The help is generated from code, so this shouldn't occur. If it does, report as a bug.

BibTeX speed commands use the same enable/disable setting as org-mode speed commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "scimax.speedCommands.enabled": true
}
#+END_SRC

For PDF and notes access, configure:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "scimax.ref.pdfDirectory": "~/Papers",
  "scimax.ref.notesDirectory": "~/Notes/papers"
}
#+END_SRC

** ✅ Comparison with Emacs org-ref
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 18:24]

These BibTeX speed commands are inspired by the functions in Emacs `org-ref-bibtex.el':

| Scimax       | Emacs org-ref Function           |
|--------------+----------------------------------|
| n            | org-ref-bibtex-next-entry        |
| p            | org-ref-bibtex-previous-entry    |
| s            | org-ref-sort-bibtex-entry        |
| d            | org-ref-downcase-bibtex-entry    |
| t            | org-ref-title-case-article       |
| S            | org-ref-sentence-case-article    |
