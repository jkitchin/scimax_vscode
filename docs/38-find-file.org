* Find File (C-x C-f)

Find File provides Emacs-style file navigation in VS Code. It displays a filterable directory listing in a webview panel where you can quickly navigate directories, open files, and perform actions like inserting file paths or org-links.

** Opening Find File

| Keybinding | Command | Description |
|------------+---------+-------------|
| ~C-x C-f~ | =scimax.findFile= | Open find-file (starts in current file's directory) |
| | =scimax.findFileHome= | Open find-file in home directory |
| | =scimax.findFileWorkspace= | Open find-file in workspace root |

** Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----+--------|
| ~Up~ / ~C-p~ | Move selection up |
| ~Down~ / ~C-n~ | Move selection down |
| ~Tab~ | Enter selected directory |
| ~Backspace~ | Go to parent directory (or delete filter character) |
| ~Enter~ | Open file in editor, or open directory in dired |
| ~PageUp~ / ~PageDown~ | Move selection by 10 |
| ~Home~ / ~End~ | Jump to first/last entry |

** Filtering

Simply type to filter the file list. The filter uses fuzzy matching - characters must appear in order but don't need to be consecutive.

| Key | Action |
|-----+--------|
| /any character/ | Add to filter |
| ~Backspace~ | Remove last filter character (or go to parent if empty) |
| ~C-u~ | Clear filter |

** Toggle Hidden Files

| Key | Action |
|-----+--------|
| ~.~ | Toggle showing hidden files (dotfiles) |

Only works when filter is empty.

** Actions Menu (M-o)

Press ~M-o~ (Option+O on Mac) to open the actions menu. Then press a speed key to execute the action, or click on an action.

| Key | Action |
|-----+--------|
| ~o~ | Open file (default) |
| ~j~ | Open in split (side-by-side) |
| ~p~ | Insert relative path at original cursor |
| ~P~ | Insert absolute path at original cursor |
| ~l~ | Insert org-link with relative path |
| ~L~ | Insert org-link with absolute path |
| ~c~ | Copy relative path to clipboard |
| ~C~ | Copy absolute path to clipboard |
| ~d~ | Open directory in dired |
| ~e~ | Open in Finder/Explorer |
| ~r~ | Rename file |
| ~D~ | Delete file |

Press ~M-o~ or ~Esc~ to cancel the actions menu.

** Path Insertion

When you invoke find-file from an editor, your cursor position is remembered. The insert actions (~p~, ~P~, ~l~, ~L~) will insert the path at that original position.

Example workflow:
1. In an org file, position cursor where you want a link
2. Press ~C-x C-f~ to open find-file
3. Navigate to the target file
4. Press ~M-o l~ to insert an org-link with relative path

Result: =[[file:relative/path/to/file.org][file.org]]= is inserted at your cursor.

** Clickable Status Bar

All status bar items are clickable:
- Click ~Tab~ to enter directory
- Click ~Enter~ to open
- Click ~M-o~ to show actions menu
- Click ~Backspace~ to go up/clear filter
- Click ~.~ to toggle hidden files
- Click ~Esc~ to quit

** Display Format

Each entry shows:
- Icon (folder or file)
- Name (directories end with /)
- Size (for files)

Directories are sorted before files, both alphabetically.

** Quitting

| Key | Action |
|-----+--------|
| ~Esc~ | Close find-file panel |
