*Keybinding Note:* This extension uses Emacs-style keybindings where Ctrl is used on all platforms (not Cmd on Mac), except where explicitly noted.

* ✅ Markdown Compatibility
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:32]

Scimax VS Code provides first-class support for org-mode files, with substantial
structural editing and navigation support for Markdown documents as well. This
chapter documents which features work in Markdown files and how to use them.

** ✅ Design Philosophy
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:32]

The extension treats Markdown as a first-class citizen for *structural editing
and navigation*. Features that rely on org-mode specific syntax (TODO states,
scheduling, clocking, properties) are not available in Markdown since they would
require non-standard Markdown extensions.

| Category                | Markdown Support | Notes                              |
|-------------------------+------------------+------------------------------------|

** ✅ Document Outline and Navigation
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:33]

Markdown files have full support for the VS Code outline view and breadcrumb
navigation.

*** ✅ Outline View
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:33]

The extension provides a =DocumentSymbolProvider= for Markdown that recognizes:

- Headings (lines starting with =#=)
- Fenced code blocks (=```language= or =~~~language=)
- YAML frontmatter title

Open the Outline view in the Explorer sidebar or press =Ctrl+Shift+O= to see the
document structure.

*** ✅ Breadcrumbs
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:33]

Breadcrumbs show the current heading hierarchy in the editor title bar. This
works automatically for Markdown files.

*** ✅ Jump to Heading
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:34]

Press =C-c C-j= to open a quick-pick menu of all headings in the current file.
Type to filter and press Enter to jump.  `Cmd-C/Shift-o' also works.

** ✅ Heading Navigation
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:35]

All heading navigation commands work in Markdown:

| Key       | Command                   | Description                      |
|-----------+---------------------------+----------------------------------|
| C-c C-n   | Next Heading              | Move to next heading (any level) |
| C-c C-p   | Previous Heading          | Move to previous heading         |
| C-c C-u   | Parent Heading            | Move to parent (higher level)    |
| C-c C-j   | Jump to Heading           | Quick-pick menu of all headings  |

Speed commands (when cursor is at column 0 of a heading line):

| Key | Action                               |
|-----+--------------------------------------|
| n   | Next heading (any level)             |
| p   | Previous heading (any level)         |
| f   | Next heading (same level - forward)  |
| b   | Previous heading (same level - back) |
| u   | Up to parent heading                 |
| j   | Jump to heading (opens menu)         |

** ✅ Heading Manipulation
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:35]

Change heading levels and move subtrees:

| Key         | Command           | Description                      |
|-------------+-------------------+----------------------------------|
| M-<left>    | Promote Heading   | Decrease level (## -> #)         |
| M-<right>   | Demote Heading    | Increase level (# -> ##)         |
| M-S-<left>  | Promote Subtree   | Promote heading and all children |
| M-S-<right> | Demote Subtree    | Demote heading and all children  |
| M-<up>      | Move Subtree Up   | Swap with previous sibling       |
| M-<down>    | Move Subtree Down | Swap with next sibling           |

*** ✅ Insert Headings
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:35]

| Key        | Command           | Description                           |
|------------+-------------------+---------------------------------------|
| C-<return> | Insert Heading    | Insert new heading at same level      |
| -          | Insert Subheading | Insert heading one level deeper       |

The extension automatically uses =#= characters for Markdown (not =*= like org).

** ✅ Subtree Operations
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:35]

All subtree operations work in Markdown:

| Command                    | Speed Key | Description                    |
|----------------------------+-----------+--------------------------------|
| scimax.org.markSubtree     | @         | Select entire subtree          |
| scimax.org.killSubtree     | w         | Cut subtree to clipboard       |
| scimax.org.cloneSubtree    | W         | Duplicate subtree below        |
| scimax.org.yankSubtree     | y         | Paste subtree from clipboard   |
| scimax.org.narrowToSubtree | s         | Focus on subtree (fold others) |
| scimax.org.widen           | S         | Unfold all (undo narrow)       |

*** ✅ Yank Subtree Level Adjustment
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:35]

When yanking (pasting) a subtree, the extension automatically adjusts heading
levels to match the context:

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
## Target Section

<!-- Yank a subtree that was cut from a different level -->
<!-- Headings are automatically adjusted to match ## level -->
#+END_SRC

** ✅ Code Block Support
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:37]

Markdown fenced code blocks have full support for:

- Detection and navigation
- Execution via Babel/Jupyter
- Block manipulation (split, merge, clone)

*** ✅ Fenced Block Syntax
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:37]

Both backtick and tilde fences are supported:

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
```python
print("Hello from Python")
```

~~~javascript
console.log("Hello from JS");
~~~
#+END_SRC

*** ✅ Code Block Navigation
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:53]

| Key       | Command              | Description                    |
|-----------+----------------------+--------------------------------|
| C-c C-v n | Next Source Block    | Jump to next fenced block      |
| C-c C-v p | Previous Source Block| Jump to previous fenced block  |
| C-c C-v g | Jump to Source Block | Quick-pick menu of all blocks  |

*** ✅ Code Block Execution
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:50]

Press =C-c C-c= inside a fenced code block to execute it. Results appear below
the block.

Supported languages include Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell, and any
language with a Jupyter kernel installed.

*** ✅ Code Block Manipulation
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:50]

| Command                        | Description                          |
|--------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| scimax.ob.splitBlock           | Split block at cursor                |
| scimax.ob.mergeWithPrevious    | Merge with previous block            |
| scimax.ob.mergeWithNext        | Merge with next block                |
| scimax.ob.insertBlockAbove     | Insert new block above               |
| scimax.ob.insertBlockBelow     | Insert new block below               |
| scimax.ob.insertBlockBelowSame | Insert block with same language      |
| scimax.ob.cloneBlock           | Duplicate current block              |
| scimax.ob.killBlock            | Delete block and results             |

The extension preserves the fence style (=```= or =~~~=) when manipulating blocks.

** ✅ Speed Commands
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:40]

Speed commands work at the beginning of Markdown headings (column 0 of a line
starting with =#=).

*** ✅ Navigation Speed Commands

** ✅ Folding
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:40]

Markdown headings support folding via the standard VS Code folding mechanism:

- Press =Tab= on a heading to cycle fold state
- Press =Shift+Tab= anywhere for global fold cycling
- Use the fold icons in the gutter

* ✅ Features Not Available in Markdown
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:40]

The following org-mode features are *not* supported in Markdown files because
they require org-specific syntax:

** ✅ Task Management
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:40]

* ✅ Tips for Markdown Users
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:40]

** ✅ Maximizing Compatibility
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:41]

To get the most out of Scimax VS Code with Markdown:

1. *Use speed commands* - Position cursor at column 0 of headings for rapid
   single-key operations

2. *Use fenced code blocks* - The extension fully supports =```language= blocks
   for execution and manipulation

3. *Use the outline view* - Provides visual navigation similar to org's sparse
   tree features

4. *Use jump commands* - =C-c C-j= for headings, =C-c C-v g= for code blocks

** ✅ When to Use Org-Mode Instead
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Mon 09:41]

Consider using org-mode files when you need:

- Task management with TODO states and priorities
- Scheduling and deadlines with agenda integration
- Time tracking with clocking
- Inherited properties and tags
- Advanced export features

Org files can be exported to Markdown when sharing with others who don't use
org-mode.
