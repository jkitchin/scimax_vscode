* ✅ Introduction
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:10]

Editmarks is a track changes system for scientific writing and collaborative editing in VS Code. Inspired by `scimax-editmarks' from Emacs Scimax, it provides a lightweight markup syntax for tracking insertions, deletions, comments, and typo corrections directly in your documents.

Unlike traditional track changes systems that rely on binary formats or external tools, editmarks uses plain text markup that works seamlessly across org-mode, Markdown, and LaTeX files. Changes remain visible and editable as plain text, making them perfect for version control systems like Git.

** ✅ Key Features
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:10]

- *Plain text markup*: Changes are visible in any text editor
- *Language-agnostic*: Works in org-mode, Markdown, LaTeX, and plain text
- *Four mark types*: Insertions, deletions, comments, and typo corrections
- *Visual highlighting*: Color-coded decorations for easy identification
- *Quick navigation*: Jump between marks with keyboard shortcuts
- *Batch operations*: Accept or reject all changes at once
- *Hover actions*: Quick accept/reject from hover tooltips
- *Summary view*: Overview of all changes in the document

** ✅ Use Cases
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:10]

1. *Document review*: Mark suggested changes when reviewing a colleague's work
2. *Collaborative editing*: Track your edits when working on shared documents
3. *Self-revision*: Keep track of your own changes during editing sessions
4. *Teaching and feedback*: Provide inline suggestions to students or mentees
5. *Version control*: Complement Git commits with inline change tracking

* ✅ Markup Syntax
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:10]

Editmarks supports two markup formats to maximize compatibility:

** ✅ Universal Format (Recommended)
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:10]

The universal format works in all document types:

#+begin_example
@@+inserted text+@@       # Insertion
@@-deleted text-@@        # Deletion
@@>comment text<@@        # Comment
@@~old text|new text~@@   # Typo correction
#+end_example

** ✅ CriticMarkup Format (Alternative)
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:10]

An alternative format inspired by CriticMarkup:

#+begin_example
{++inserted text++}       # Insertion
{--deleted text--}        # Deletion
{>>comment text<<}        # Comment
{~~old text~>new text~~}  # Typo correction
#+end_example

Both formats are recognized and rendered identically. Choose whichever you prefer or is required by your workflow.

* Keybinding Pattern

All editmarks keybindings follow the pattern `C-c e <letter>':

- `C-c e' → Editmarks prefix
- `i' → Insertion
- `d' → Deletion
- `c' → Comment
- `t' → Typo
- `a' → Accept
- `r' → Reject
- `s' → Summary
- `[' → Previous
- `]' → Next

This consistent pattern makes the commands easy to remember and discover.

* Typical Workflows

** Workflow 1: Peer Review

*Scenario*: You're reviewing a colleague's research paper draft.

1. *Open the document* in VS Code
2. *Read through* and identify areas needing changes
3. *Mark suggestions*:
   - Select unclear text, press `C-c e c', add comment: "Can you clarify this?"
   - Select redundant phrase, press `C-c e d' to mark for deletion
   - Place cursor after a sentence, press `C-c e i', suggest additional text
4. *Add typo corrections*:
   - Select "occured", press `C-c e t', type "occurred"
5. *Save the document* and send back to colleague
6. *Colleague reviews* using `C-c e ]' to navigate between marks
7. *Colleague processes* each mark:
   - Press `C-c e a' to accept
   - Press `C-c e r' to reject
   - Or use hover tooltips for quick decisions
8. *Save final version* with all changes resolved

** Workflow 2: Self-Editing

*Scenario*: You're revising your own manuscript and want to track changes.

1. *Enable editmarks mode* (always on - no toggle needed)
2. *As you edit*, use editmarks instead of direct changes:
   - Instead of deleting text: select it and `C-c e d'
   - Instead of adding text: `C-c e i' to insert
   - Mark uncertainties: `C-c e c' with "TODO: verify this"
3. *Take a break* - changes are preserved in plain text
4. *Review later*:
   - Open document and press `C-c e s' for summary
   - See all your pending changes at a glance
5. *Process systematically*:
   - Use `C-c e ]' to jump between marks
   - Accept or reject each change thoughtfully
6. *Commit to version control* with clear change history

** Workflow 3: Collaborative Writing

*Scenario*: Multiple authors working on a shared document in a Git repository.

1. *Author A* makes initial draft
2. *Author B* checks out the branch and adds suggestions:
   #+begin_example
   The analysis @@>Author B: should we mention the control group here?<@@
   showed @@+significant+@@ results.
   #+end_example
3. *Author C* adds more changes:
   #+begin_example
   The analysis @@>Author B: should we mention the control group here?<@@
   showed @@+significant+@@ results @@>(Author C: p < 0.01)+@@.
   #+end_example
4. *Authors meet* to review:
   - Open document and press `C-c e s'
   - Discuss each mark in the summary
   - Navigate with `C-c e ]' / `C-c e ['
5. *Accept/reject collaboratively*
6. *Commit final version* to Git with all changes incorporated

** Workflow 4: Student Feedback

*Scenario*: Providing detailed feedback on student writing.

1. *Open student's submission*
2. *Read through once* without marking
3. *Second pass - mark issues*:
   - Grammar/spelling: Use `C-c e t' for typos
   - Clarity issues: `C-c e c' with specific questions
   - Structural problems: `C-c e i' to suggest additional sentences
   - Verbose sections: `C-c e d' with comments explaining why
4. *Add pedagogical comments*:
   #+begin_example
   @@>Good use of evidence here! Consider adding more analysis of what
   this means for your thesis.<@@
   #+end_example
5. *Generate summary report*:
   - Press `C-c e s'
   - Show student: "You have 5 typos, 3 clarity issues, 2 structural suggestions"
6. *Student processes feedback*:
   - Uses navigation to review each mark
   - Reads hover tooltips for quick context
   - Accepts corrections, addresses comments
   - Removes comment marks after addressing them

** Workflow 5: Document Review Cycle

*Scenario*: Multiple rounds of review with stakeholder feedback.

*Round 1 - Reviewer marks changes*:
#+begin_example
The project will @@+likely+@@ be completed @@-on time-@@ @@+ahead of schedule+@@.
@@>Reviewer: Source for this claim?<@@
#+end_example

*Round 2 - Author responds*:
#+begin_example
The project will @@+likely+@@ be completed @@+ahead of schedule+@@.
@@>Author: Added reference below. See Smith et al. 2025<@@
[ref added here]
#+end_example

*Round 3 - Final acceptance*:
1. Reviewer opens document
2. Presses `C-c e s' to see all outstanding marks
3. Navigates with `C-c e ]' through each change
4. Presses `C-c e a' to accept all approved changes
5. Final document is clean and ready for publication

* ✅ Best Practices
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:17]

** ✅ Do's
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:17]

1. *Use descriptive comments*: Instead of `@@>fix this<@@', write `@@>fix grammar: subject-verb agreement<@@'
2. *Be specific with insertions*: Show exactly what you're suggesting
3. *One change per mark*: Don't combine multiple edits in one mark
4. *Review systematically*: Use navigation commands to ensure you don't miss any marks
5. *Preserve marks in Git*: Commit documents with editmarks to track review history
6. *Use hover tooltips*: Quick way to remind yourself what each mark does

** ✅ Don'ts
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:17]

1. *Don't nest editmarks*: Avoid `@@+text @@-with-@@ nesting+@@' - it's confusing
2. *Don't mix formats randomly*: Pick either universal or CriticMarkup and stick with it
3. *Don't leave marks indefinitely*: Process them regularly to keep documents clean
4. *Don't delete marks manually*: Use accept/reject commands to ensure proper processing
5. *Don't use for version control*: Editmarks complement Git but don't replace it

** ✅ Tips
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:17]

- *Quick review*: Use `C-c e s' at the start of each editing session to see pending changes
- *Batch processing*: For documents with many trivial changes, use "Accept All" after review
- *Comments as TODO*: Use comment marks as inline TODO items during writing
- *Color awareness*: Learn to recognize mark types by color for faster visual scanning
- *Git integration*: Create commits after processing editmarks with descriptive messages
- *Keyboard efficiency*: The navigation keys (`[' and `]') combined with `a'/`r' enable fast review

* ✅ Integration with Other Features
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:18]

** ✅ Source Blocks
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:18]

Editmarks work inside source blocks (although they likely break the code unless you use them in comments.):

#+begin_src python
def calculate(x):
    return x * @@+2+@@ @@-3-@@  @@>why change the multiplier?<@@
#+end_src

This is useful when reviewing code snippets in documentation or educational materials.

** ✅ Tables
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:19]

Use editmarks in table cells:

| Item   | Original    | Revised        | Notes                    |
|--------+-------------+----------------+--------------------------|
| Budget | @@-$100K-@@ | @@+$120K+@@    | @@>approved by CFO<@@    |
| Time   | 6 months    | @@+8 months+@@ | @@>realistic estimate<@@ |

** 👀 Export Compatibility

Editmarks are fully supported in HTML, LaTeX, and PDF exports. The export behavior is controlled by the =scimax.export.editmarkMode= setting.

*** Export Modes

| Mode     | Description                                              |
|----------+----------------------------------------------------------|
| =show=   | Render with visual markup (colored insertions/deletions) |
| =accept= | Apply all changes (keep insertions, remove deletions)    |
| =reject= | Revert all changes (remove insertions, keep deletions)   |
| =hide=   | Remove all editmarks without any replacement             |

*** HTML Export

In HTML, editmarks are rendered using semantic HTML elements with CSS styling:

- *Insertions*: =<ins class="editmark-ins">text</ins>= (green background)
- *Deletions*: =<del class="editmark-del">text</del>= (red background, strikethrough)
- *Comments*: =<mark class="editmark-comment">text</mark>= (yellow background, italic)
- *Typos*: =<span class="editmark-typo"><del>old</del><ins>new</ins></span>=

*** LaTeX/PDF Export

In LaTeX, editmarks use custom commands defined in the preamble:

#+begin_example
\editins{inserted text}           % Green underlined text
\editdel{deleted text}            % Red strikethrough text
\editcomment{comment text}        % Orange italic text in brackets
\edittypo{old text}{new text}     % Old crossed out, new inserted
#+end_example

The required packages (=xcolor=, =ulem=) and command definitions are automatically added to the preamble when editmarks are detected.

*** Configuration

Set the export mode in VS Code settings:

#+begin_src json
{
  "scimax.export.editmarkMode": "show"
}
#+end_src

Or use the Settings UI: Search for "editmark" and select the desired mode.

*** Workflow Recommendations

- *Draft review*: Use =show= mode to see all changes visually in the export
- *Final publication*: Use =accept= or =reject= mode, or process marks manually before export
- *Clean copy*: Use =hide= to remove all editmarks without deciding on them

** ✅ Version Control
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:19]

Editmarks are perfect for version control workflows:

#+begin_src bash
# Add document with editmarks
git add manuscript.org

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add reviewer feedback as editmarks"

# Later, after processing
git add manuscript.org
git commit -m "Incorporate reviewer suggestions"
#+end_src

The diff shows both the markup and the final changes, providing complete review history.

* ✅ Troubleshooting
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:19]

** ✅ Editmarks Not Showing
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:19]

*Problem*: Markup is visible but not decorated with colors.

*Solutions*:
1. Check that you're in a supported file (any text file works)
2. Reload window: `C-S-P' → "Developer: Reload Window"
3. Verify syntax: Ensure markup is exactly correct (e.g., `@@+text+@@' not `@@+ text +@@')

** ✅ Navigation Not Working
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:19]

*Problem*: `C-c e ]' doesn't jump to next mark.

*Solutions*:
1. Verify editmarks exist: Press `C-c e s' to see summary
2. Ensure cursor is in the editor window
3. Check keybinding conflicts: File → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts

** Accept/Reject Not Working

*Problem*: Nothing happens when pressing `C-c e a'.

*Solutions*:
1. Position cursor *inside* the editmark (between the markup symbols)
2. Hover over the mark to see the tooltip - if visible, cursor is positioned correctly
3. Check that the editmark syntax is valid

** ✅ Nested Marks Issue
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:19]

*Problem*: Marks inside other marks behave unexpectedly.

*Solution*: Don't nest editmarks. Instead, process the inner mark first, then add the outer mark.

** ✅ Performance with Many Marks
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:19]

*Problem*: Editor becomes slow with hundreds of editmarks.

*Solutions*:
1. Process marks in batches (accept/reject groups of related changes)
2. Use "Accept All" or "Reject All" for bulk processing
3. Split large documents into smaller files

* ✅ FAQ
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:19]

** Q: Can I customize the colors?

A: Currently, colors are fixed (green for insertion, red for deletion, yellow for comments, orange for typos). Custom theme support may be added in future versions.

** Q: Do editmarks work in any file type?

A: Yes! Editmarks work in any text file: .org, .md, .tex, .txt, .py, etc. The markup is plain text.

** Q: Can I export documents with editmarks?

A: Yes! Editmarks are fully supported in HTML, LaTeX, and PDF exports. Use the =scimax.export.editmarkMode= setting to control how they appear:
- =show=: Visual markup with colors (default)
- =accept=: Apply all changes automatically
- =reject=: Revert all changes
- =hide=: Remove editmarks silently

** Q: How do I see who made which mark?

A: Editmarks don't automatically track authors. Add author names manually in comments:
#+begin_example
@@>(Author: John Doe) This needs clarification<@@

** Q: Can I use editmarks with Word documents?

A: No, editmarks require plain text files. Convert Word documents to Markdown or use Word's built-in track changes.

** Q: Do editmarks interfere with syntax highlighting?

A: No, they're implemented as decorations that overlay the text without modifying syntax highlighting.

** Q: Can I undo an accept/reject action?

A: Yes, use VS Code's regular undo (`C-z') immediately after accepting or rejecting a mark.

** Q: Are editmarks saved with the file?

A: Yes! Editmarks are plain text markup, so they're saved as part of the document content.

** Q: Can I search for editmarks?

A: Yes, use regular search (`C-f') for `@@+' or `{++' to find all insertions, etc. Or use `C-c e s' for the summary view.
