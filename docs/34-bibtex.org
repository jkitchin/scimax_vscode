** ✅ When to Use This
CLOSED: [2026-01-21 Wed 07:19]

This document covers editing =.bib= files directly. For inserting and managing citations in org/markdown/LaTeX documents, see [[file:19-references.org][References and Citations]].

* ✅ Speed Commands
CLOSED: [2026-01-21 Wed 07:27]

BibTeX speed commands are single-key shortcuts available when your cursor is at column 0 of a line starting with =@= (an entry definition line like =@article{=).

** ✅ Enabling Speed Commands
CLOSED: [2026-01-21 Wed 07:19]

Speed commands are enabled by default for BibTeX files. The context =scimax.atBibtexEntryStart= is automatically set when appropriate.

Cleans the current entry by:
- Normalizing whitespace (single spaces, trimmed)
- Lowercasing field names
- Sorting fields in standard BibTeX order
- Removing duplicate outer braces (={{Title}}= → ={Title}=)
- Preserving inner braces for case protection (={DNA}= stays as-is)

Before:
#+BEGIN_SRC bibtex
@Article{Smith2020,
  AUTHOR = {  John   Smith  },
  TITLE = {{A Machine Learning Approach}},
  Year = {2020},
  Journal = {Nature}
}

** Sort Fields

Command: =scimax.bibtex.sortFields= (speed key: =s=)

Reorders fields in standard BibTeX order:
1. author, title, journaltitle/journal, booktitle
2. editor, edition, volume, number, issue, pages
3. publisher, location/address, year, date, month
4. doi, url, urldate, isbn, issn
5. eprint, eprinttype, archiveprefix, primaryclass
6. note, annote, abstract, keywords, file
7. Any remaining fields

** Downcase Entry

Command: =scimax.bibtex.downcaseEntry= (speed key: =d=)

Lowercases the entry type and all field names:
- =@Article= → =@article=
- =Author = = → =author ==
- =JOURNAL = = → =journal ==

** Wrap in Braces

Command: =scimax.bibtex.wrapBraces= (speed key: =b=, keybinding: =Cmd+Shift+]=)

Wraps the current selection or word in curly braces for case protection.

Use this to protect:
- Acronyms: DNA → {DNA}
- Proper nouns: Python → {Python}
- Chemical formulas: H2O → {H2O}

** 👀 Strip Braces

Command: =scimax.bibtex.stripBraces= (speed key: =B=, keybinding: =Cmd+Shift+[=)

Strips all internal braces from the current entry. Useful for cleaning up entries where braces have been overused.

Before:
#+BEGIN_SRC bibtex
@article{smith2024,
  author = {John Smith},
  title = {{A} {Study} of {Machine} {Learning}},
  journal = {{Nature}},
  year = {2024}
}
#+END_SRC

After:
#+BEGIN_SRC bibtex
@article{smith2024,
  author = {John Smith},
  title = {A Study of Machine Learning},
  journal = {Nature},
  year = {2024}
}
#+END_SRC

Note: This removes ALL internal braces. If you need to preserve specific braces (like ={DNA}=), you'll need to re-add them after running this command.

* ✅ File Operations
CLOSED: [2026-01-21 Wed 12:56]

These commands operate on the entire BibTeX file.

** Sort Entries

Command: =scimax.bibtex.sortEntries=

| Option    | Description                                  |
|-----------+----------------------------------------------|
| By Key    | Alphabetically by citation key               |
| By Year   | Oldest to newest (secondary: key)            |
| By Author | Alphabetically by first author last name     |
|           | (secondary: year, then key)                  |

The command preserves any preamble content (comments, =@string= definitions) at the top of the file.

** Apply Operation to All Entries

Command: =scimax.bibtex.applyToAllEntries=

Applies a transformation to every entry in the file. Shows a menu of operations:

| {National Academy of Sciences} | Literal name: National Academy of Sciences |
| {World Health Organization}    | Literal name: World Health Organization    |

** Key Generation with Authors

When generating citation keys, the first author's last name is used:
- Particles are stripped for the key (van der Berg → berg)
- Corporate names are cleaned (NASA → nasa)
- Accents are normalized (Müller → muller)

* ✅ Best Practices
CLOSED: [2026-01-21 Wed 07:58]

** ✅ Entry Formatting
CLOSED: [2026-01-21 Wed 07:58]

1. *Use consistent case* - Run "Downcase Entries" on your file
2. *Sort fields consistently* - Use "Clean Entries" or "Sort Fields"
3. *Protect case-sensitive text* - Wrap in braces: ={DNA}=, ={Python}=, ={NASA}=
4. *Include DOIs* - Enables OpenAlex integration and hover previews

** ✅ Key Naming
CLOSED: [2026-01-21 Wed 07:58]

Recommended format: =author-year-keyword= or =authoryearkeyword=

Good keys:
- =smith-2024-machine= or =smith2024machine=
- =vandenberg-2023-neural= (note: particle stripped)
- =nasa-2022-report=

Bad keys:
- =ref1=, =paper2= (not memorable)
- =ML_Paper_2024= (inconsistent format)

** ✅ File Organization
CLOSED: [2026-01-21 Wed 07:58]

- One bibliography file per project or topic
- Use =@string= definitions for common journals
- Keep entries in consistent order (by key or year)
- Regularly validate files for errors

** ✅ Before Sharing
CLOSED: [2026-01-21 Wed 07:58]

1. Run =scimax.bibtex.validateFile= to check for errors
2. Run "Clean Entries" via =scimax.bibtex.applyToAllEntries=
3. Optionally sort entries by key or year

* Journal Abbreviations

Scimax includes a comprehensive journal abbreviation database that allows you to toggle between full journal names and their standardized ISO 4 abbreviations.

** Data Sources

The abbreviation database is sourced from the [[https://github.com/JabRef/abbrv.jabref.org][JabRef Abbreviation Repository]], which aggregates abbreviations from multiple authoritative sources:

| Source              | Description                                    | Entries |

| Entrez/PubMed       | Medline abbreviations (dotless format)         | ~19,500 |
| Life Science        | Biology and life science journals              | ~9,700  |
| Index Medicus       | NLM/Index Medicus abbreviations                | ~3,200  |
| Mathematics         | Mathematics journals from MathSciNet           | ~3,800  |
| Geology & Physics   | Geology and physics journals                   | ~1,300  |
| Mechanical          | Mechanical and biomechanical engineering       | ~4,800  |
| Astronomy           | Astronomy and astrophysics journals            | ~20     |
| Meteorology         | Atmospheric science journals                   | ~120    |
| Sociology           | Sociology journals                             | ~100    |
| AEA (Economics)     | American Economic Association journals         | ~1,000  |

Total: approximately 50,000 abbreviation entries.

** ✅ Important: Use Version Control
CLOSED: [2026-01-21 Wed 07:58]

Before making batch changes to your bibliography files, ensure your files are under version control (git). This allows you to:
- Review changes with =git diff=
- Undo changes with =git checkout= if something goes wrong
- Track the history of modifications

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*Tip*: Commit your .bib file before running batch abbreviation operations. If anything goes wrong, you can always revert.
#+END_QUOTE

** ✅ Toggling Journal Names
CLOSED: [2026-01-21 Wed 07:58]

*** ✅ Single Entry (Speed Key: A)
CLOSED: [2026-01-21 Wed 07:58]

Command: =scimax.bibtex.toggleJournalAbbreviation= (speed key: =A=)

Toggles the journal field between full name and abbreviation:

Before:
#+BEGIN_SRC bibtex
@article{smith2024,
  author = {John Smith},
  title = {A Great Paper},
  journal = {Journal of the American Chemical Society},
  year = {2024}
}
#+END_SRC

After pressing =A=:
#+BEGIN_SRC bibtex
@article{smith2024,
  author = {John Smith},
  title = {A Great Paper},
  journal = {J. Am. Chem. Soc.},
  year = {2024}
}
#+END_SRC

Press =A= again to toggle back to the full name.

*** ✅ All Entries
CLOSED: [2026-01-21 Wed 07:58]

| Command                                | Description                            |
|----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
| scimax.bibtex.abbreviateAllJournals    | Abbreviate all journals in the file    |
| scimax.bibtex.expandAllJournals        | Expand all journals to full names      |

These commands:
1. *Validate syntax* before starting - warns if parse errors exist
2. Process every entry in the file
3. *Validate results* - checks that entry count is preserved
4. Report how many journals were changed and not found

If validation fails, changes are not applied.

*** ✅ Undo Behavior
CLOSED: [2026-01-21 Wed 07:58]

All batch changes are applied as a *single edit operation*, so:
- Press =Ctrl+Z= (=Cmd+Z= on Mac) *once* to undo all changes at once
- You cannot undo individual journal changes within a batch operation
- For more granular control, use the single-entry toggle (=A= speed key) instead

For single-entry toggles (speed key =A=), each toggle is a separate undo operation.
