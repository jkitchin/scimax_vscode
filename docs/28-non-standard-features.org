* ✅ Overview
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 11:08]

Scimax VS Code implements several features that are *not part* of the official
org-mode syntax specification at https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html.
These features are inspired by Emacs packages like org-ref and scimax, and
provide additional functionality for scientific writing.

This document describes these non-standard features and their behavior during
export.

* ✅ org-ref Citation Links
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 11:15]

The citation system (`cite:', `citet:', `citep:', etc.) comes from the org-ref
package for Emacs, not from core org-mode.

** ✅ Citation Styles
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 11:15]

| Style           | Syntax              | Description                    |
|-----------------+---------------------+--------------------------------|
| cite            | cite:key            | Basic citation                 |
| citet           | citet:key           | Textual citation (Author, Year)|
| citep           | citep:key           | Parenthetical citation         |
| citeauthor      | citeauthor:key      | Author name only               |
| citeyear        | citeyear:key        | Year only                      |
| Multiple        | cite:key1,key2,key3 | Comma-separated keys           |

** ✅ Export Behavior
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 11:16]

*** ✅ LaTeX/PDF Export
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 11:16]

Citations are converted directly to LaTeX cite commands:

| Org Citation     | LaTeX Output        |
|------------------+---------------------|
| cite:key         | \cite{key}          |
| citet:key        | \citet{key}         |
| citep:key        | \citep{key}         |
| citeauthor:key   | \citeauthor{key}    |
| citeyear:key     | \citeyear{key}      |
| cite:k1,k2       | \cite{k1,k2}        |

Requires `natbib' or `biblatex' package in your LaTeX preamble.

*** ✅ HTML Export
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 11:16]

Citations are rendered as clickable links with CSS classes for styling.

*** ✅ Markdown Export
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 11:16]

Citations are converted to Pandoc-style citations:

| Org Citation     | Pandoc Markdown     |
|------------------+---------------------|
| cite:key         | [@key]              |
| citet:key        | @key                |
| citep:key        | [@key]              |
| cite:k1,k2       | [@k1; @k2]          |

** ✅ Compatibility Notes
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 11:16]

- Emacs org-mode users will find this syntax familiar
- Standard org-mode uses `[[cite:@key]]' syntax (org-cite) which is also supported
- The org-ref style `cite:key' is more concise for scientific writing

See [[file:19-references.org][References]] for full documentation.

* ✅ Emacs-style Command Markup
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 11:17]

The command markup syntax `command' (backtick  text  single quote) is used
in Emacs documentation to reference commands, functions, and key sequences.

This renders with dark red highlighting in the editor (with the Leuven theme).

** ✅ Keybinding
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 11:17]

| Key   | Command                 | Description          |
|-------+-------------------------+----------------------|
| C-c ' | scimax.markup.command   | Insert command markup|

When text is selected, it wraps the selection. Otherwise, it inserts the
markers and positions the cursor between them.

** ✅ Export Behavior
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 11:17]

*** ✅ HTML Export
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 11:17]

Command markup is exported as `<kbd>' elements:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
`my-command' → <kbd>my-command</kbd>
#+END_EXAMPLE

The `<kbd>' element is semantically appropriate for keyboard input and command
names.

*** ✅ LaTeX Export
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 11:17]

Command markup is exported as `\texttt{}':

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
`my-command' → \texttt{my-command}
#+END_EXAMPLE

** ✅ Why Non-Standard?
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 11:18]

- This syntax is not part of the org-mode specification
- Standard org code markup uses ~code~ or =verbatim=
- The ``command'' style is specific to Emacs/Elisp documentation conventions
- We implement it for Emacs users who are familiar with this convention and because we think it looks nicer.

** ✅ Alternatives
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 11:18]

If you need portable org documents, use standard markup:

| Our Syntax  | Standard Alternative | Description          |
|-------------+----------------------+----------------------|
| `command'   | ~command~            | Org code markup      |
| `command'   | =command=            | Org verbatim markup  |

* ✅ Future Non-Standard Features
CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 11:19]

This section will be updated as additional non-standard features are added.
