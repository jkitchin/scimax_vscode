* Getting Started

This guide will help you install Scimax VS Code and get started with its core
features. By the end, you'll be able to create structured documents, execute
code, and navigate efficiently.

* System Requirements

** VS Code Version

Scimax VS Code requires Visual Studio Code version *1.85 or later*.

** Optional Dependencies

While Scimax VS Code works out of the box, some features require additional
software:

*** For Code Execution

| Language   | Requirement                                    |
|------------+------------------------------------------------|
| Python     | Python 3.x installed and in PATH               |
| JavaScript | Node.js installed                              |
| Shell      | Bash or compatible shell                       |
| R          | R installed with Rscript in PATH               |
| Julia      | Julia installed and in PATH                    |

*** For Jupyter Integration

- Jupyter installed (`pip install jupyter')
- Jupyter kernels for desired languages

*** For LaTeX/PDF Export

- TeX distribution (TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX)
- pdflatex, xelatex, or lualatex compiler

*** For LaTeX Equation Preview

- LaTeX distribution with dvipng or dvisvgm

* Installation

** From VS Code Marketplace

1. Open VS Code
2. Press `C-S-X' to open the Extensions view
3. Search for "Scimax"
4. Click *Install*

** From VSIX File

1. Download the `.vsix' file from the [[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax_vscode/releases][GitHub Releases page]]
2. Open VS Code
3. Press `C-S-X' to open the Extensions view
4. Click the `...' menu (top right)
5. Select "Install from VSIX..."
6. Choose the downloaded file

** From Source (GitHub)

The source code is available at [[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax_vscode]].

To build and install from source:

1. Clone the repository:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   git clone https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax_vscode.git
   cd scimax_vscode
   #+END_SRC

2. Install dependencies and build:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   npm install
   make
   #+END_SRC

3. Install the generated VSIX:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   code --install-extension scimax-vscode-*.vsix
   #+END_SRC

** Verify Installation

After installation:

1. Open the Command Palette (`C-S-P')
2. Type "Scimax"
3. You should see Scimax commands listed

* First Steps

** Opening an Org File

Org files use the `.org' extension. To create your first file:

1. Press `C-n' to create a new file (note s-n on Mac)
2. Save it with `C-s' and give it a `.org' extension (e.g., `notes.org')
3. The file will automatically use org-mode syntax highlighting

** Creating Your First Document

Type the following to create a basic document structure:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+TITLE: My First Document
,#+AUTHOR: Your Name
,#+DATE: 2026-01-13

,* Introduction

This is my first Scimax VS Code document.

,** A Subsection

Content under the subsection.

,* Tasks

,** TODO Learn Scimax VS Code
DEADLINE: <2026-01-20 Mon>

,** DONE Install the extension
CLOSED: [2026-01-13 Mon]

,* Code Example

,#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
print("Hello from Scimax VS Code!")
,#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

** Basic Navigation

*** Folding

- Press `Tab' on a heading to cycle its visibility (folded/children/subtree)
- Press `S-<tab>' anywhere to cycle global visibility

*bold* /italics/

*** Moving Between Headings

| Key         | Action                   |
|-------------+--------------------------|
| `C-c C-j'   | Jump to any heading      |
| `M-<up>'    | Move heading up          |
| `M-<down>'  | Move heading down        |
| `M-<left>'  | Promote heading (←level) |
| `M-<right>' | Demote heading (→level)  |
*** Executing Code

1. Place your cursor inside a source block
2. Press `C-<return>' or `C-c C-c'
3. Results appear below the block

* Understanding the Interface

** Outline View

The Outline view in VS Code's sidebar shows your document structure:

1. Click the Outline icon in the sidebar (or press `C-S-O')
2. See all headings hierarchically
3. Click a heading to jump to it

** Tree Views

Scimax VS Code adds several tree views to the Explorer sidebar:

*** Journal Tree

Shows your journal entries organized by date. Access today's entry with
`C-S-J' (or `s-S-J' on Mac).

*** Projects Tree

Shows your registered projects for quick navigation.

*** Agenda Tree

Shows TODO items, deadlines, and scheduled tasks across your files.

** Status Bar

The status bar shows:

- Current journal date (when in journal files)
- Kernel status (when using Jupyter)

** Hydra Menus

Hydra menus provide discoverable access to commands:

- `C-c m' - Open main menu
- `C-c C-m' - Open context-sensitive menu
- `C-M-V' - Open database/search menu

Menus show available commands with their keybindings. Press a key to execute
a command or `Escape' to close the menu.

** Essential Settings

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  // Enable speed commands (single-key at heading start)
  "scimax.speedCommands.enabled": true,

  // Set your journal directory
  "scimax.journal.directory": "~/Documents/journal",

  // Configure bibliography files for citations
  "scimax.ref.bibliographyFiles": ["~/references.bib"],

  "scimax.literate.pythonPath": "/usr/bin/python3"
}
#+END_SRC

** LaTeX Configuration

For PDF export:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "scimax.latexLivePreview.compiler": "pdflatex",
  "scimax.latexLivePreview.useLatexmk": true
}
#+END_SRC

* Migrating from Emacs

If you're coming from Emacs Org-mode or Scimax, here are key differences:

** Similar Features

| Emacs            | VS Code                   |
|------------------+---------------------------|
| =C-c C-c=        | =C-c C-c=           |
| =C-c C-t=        | =C-c C-t=           |
| =C-c C-e=        | =C-c C-e=           |
| =TAB= on heading | =Tab= on heading          |
| =S-TAB=          | =S-<tab>=               |
| =M-RET=          | =C-<return>= (at heading) |
| =M-left/right=   | =M-<left>/Right=          |
| =M-up/down=      | =M-<up>/Down=             |
| Speed commands   | Same keys (when enabled)  |

** Different Behaviors

- *Completion*: Uses VS Code's completion system, triggered automatically
- *Folding*: Uses VS Code's native folding with org-specific ranges
- *Buffer management*: VS Code tabs instead of Emacs buffers
- *Customization*: JSON settings instead of Emacs Lisp

** Missing Features

Some advanced Emacs features may not be available:

- Org-mode's full capture/refile system (simplified version available)
- Column view
- Some specialized agenda views
- Custom link types (limited set supported)

* Next Steps

Now that you're set up, explore these topics:

1. [[file:02-document-structure.org][Document Structure]] - Master headings, folding, and navigation
2. [[file:03-todo-items.org][TODO Items]] - Learn task management
3. [[file:07-source-blocks.org][Source Code Blocks]] - Execute code in your documents
4. [[file:24-keybindings.org][Keybindings]] - Learn all keyboard shortcuts

* Troubleshooting

** Code Blocks Not Executing

1. Check that the language is installed (e.g., Python, Node.js)
2. Verify the language is in your PATH
3. Check the Output panel (`C-S-U') for errors
4. Run `scimax.org.checkExecutors' to verify available executors

** LaTeX Preview Not Working

1. Ensure LaTeX is installed (`latex --version' in terminal)
2. Check that dvipng or dvisvgm is available
3. Run `scimax.checkLatexTools' to verify installation

** Search Not Finding Results

1. Run `scimax.db.reindex' to rebuild the search index
2. Check that files aren't in excluded patterns
3. Verify the search scope (`scimax.db.setScope')

** Journal Not Opening

1. Check that `scimax.journal.directory' is set correctly
2. Ensure the directory exists and is writable
3. Try creating the directory manually if needed
