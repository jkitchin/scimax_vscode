** ⚠️ Special Commands

Additional utility commands.

| Key | Command                  | Description                                       |
|-----+--------------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| ~N~ | Narrow to subtree        | Focus only on current subtree (hide others)       |
| ~S~ | Widen                    | Show all content (undo narrowing)                 |
| ~?~ | Speed commands help      | Show this help in quick pick menu                 |

*** ⚠️ Narrowing

Narrowing focuses your view on a single subtree, hiding all other content. This is useful for:
- Focusing on a specific section while writing
- Reducing distractions
- Presenting a single topic
- Temporarily isolating content for editing

After narrowing with ~N~, press ~S~ (at any heading) to restore the full view.
