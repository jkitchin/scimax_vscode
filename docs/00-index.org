* Scimax VS Code

Scimax VS Code is a comprehensive scientific computing extension for Visual
Studio Code, inspired by the powerful [[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax][Scimax]] package for Emacs. It brings
literate programming, knowledge management, and scientific writing capabilities
to VS Code users.

** What is Scimax VS Code?

Scimax VS Code transforms Visual Studio Code into a powerful environment for:

- *Literate Programming* - Write documents that combine prose and executable code
- *Scientific Computing* - Execute code in 30+ languages with Jupyter integration
- *Knowledge Management* - Organize notes, tasks, and references in structured documents
- *Academic Writing* - Manage citations, export to LaTeX/PDF, and write papers

The extension provides first-class support for org-mode files (.org), with
full structural editing and navigation support for Markdown documents (see
[[file:30-markdown-compatibility.org][Markdown Compatibility]]).

** Key Features

*** Document Structure

Create hierarchical documents with collapsible headings, properties, and tags.
Navigate efficiently with outline views, heading jumps, and fuzzy search.

- Unlimited heading levels with folding support
- Tags and inherited tags for organization
- Properties drawers for metadata
- Speed commands for rapid navigation

See [[file:02-document-structure.org][Document Structure]] for details.

*** Task Management

Track tasks with TODO states, priorities, deadlines, and scheduling.

- Multiple TODO states (TODO, DONE, WAITING, NEXT, HOLD, CANCELLED)
- Priorities [#A], [#B], [#C]
- Checkbox lists with progress tracking [2/5]
- Deadline and scheduled timestamps with warnings

See [[file:03-todo-items.org][TODO Items]] for details.

*** Tables

*** Source Code Execution

Execute code blocks in 30+ programming languages directly in your documents.

- Python, JavaScript, Shell, R, Julia, and more
- Jupyter kernel integration for rich output
- Session support for stateful execution
- Code tangling for extracting source files
- Variable passing between blocks

See [[file:07-source-blocks.org][Source Code Blocks]] for details.

*** Export

Export documents to multiple formats with customizable options.

- HTML with syntax highlighting

** Quick Start

1. *Install the extension* from the VS Code marketplace or from a VSIX file

2. *Open or create an org file* with the `.org' extension

3. *Create a heading* by typing `* My First Heading'

4. *Add a source block* and execute it:
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
   ,#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
   print("Hello, Scimax VS Code!")
   ,#+END_SRC
   #+END_SRC
   Press `C-<return>' or `C-c C-c' to execute.

5. *Explore the menus* with `C-c m' (main menu) or `C-c C-m' (context menu)

See [[file:01-getting-started.org][Getting Started]] for a complete introduction.

** Getting Help

*** Within VS Code

- Press `C-c m' to open the main Hydra menu
- Press `C-c C-m' for context-sensitive menus
- Use `C-S-P' and search for "Scimax" commands
- Hover over elements for tooltips and information

*** Online Resources

- GitHub Issues: Report bugs and request features
- Documentation: This documentation set

*** Keybinding Help

Press `? ' at the beginning of a heading (with speed commands enabled) to
see available speed commands.

See [[file:24-keybindings.org][Keybindings]] for the complete reference.
