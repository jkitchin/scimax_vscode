#+TITLE: Unsupported and Limited Features
#+AUTHOR: Scimax VS Code
#+STARTUP: showall

This document lists org-mode and Emacs features that are not supported or have limited functionality in scimax-vscode due to fundamental differences between Emacs and VS Code.

* Display Limitations

** Link Folding (Descriptive Links)

In Emacs org-mode, links with descriptions like =[[https://example.com][Example]]= can be displayed in a "folded" state showing only "Example" with the URL hidden. The full link is revealed on cursor hover or edit.

*VS Code limitation*: VS Code does not support this kind of dynamic text folding. Links are always displayed in their full form: =[[https://example.com][Example]]=.

*Workaround*: None. You can use the hover preview to see a clickable version of the link.

** Inline Image Display

In Emacs org-mode, images can be displayed inline within the buffer using =org-toggle-inline-images= (=C-c C-x C-v=). Images appear directly in the text where the link is.

*VS Code limitation*: VS Code's text editor does not support embedding images within the text buffer.

*Workaround*: Scimax-vscode provides:
- Hover tooltips that show image previews when you hover over image links
- Gutter icons for source block output images
- The Image Overlay panel (=Ctrl+Shift+I=) for viewing all images in the document

** LaTeX Fragment Preview

In Emacs org-mode, LaTeX fragments like =\(E=mc^2\)= or =\begin{equation}...= can be rendered as images inline using =org-latex-preview=.

*VS Code limitation*: No inline LaTeX rendering in the editor.

*Workaround*:
- Use the LaTeX Live Preview panel (=Ctrl+Shift+L=) to see rendered LaTeX
- Hover over LaTeX fragments to see a preview
- Export to PDF/HTML to see rendered math

* Editing Limitations

** Indirect Buffers for Source Blocks

In Emacs, =org-edit-special= (=C-c '=) opens source blocks in a separate "indirect buffer" with the appropriate major mode. This provides full language support (completion, syntax checking, etc.) while maintaining the connection to the original org file.

*VS Code limitation*: VS Code does not have the concept of indirect buffers.

*Workaround*: Scimax-vscode provides:
- Syntax highlighting for source blocks via embedded language grammars
- Language-specific completions within source blocks (partial)
- You can extract code to a separate file using tangling (=:tangle filename=)

** Column View

In Emacs org-mode, =org-columns= provides a spreadsheet-like view of headline properties in a columnar format, useful for project planning and time tracking.

*VS Code limitation*: Not implemented. VS Code's editor model doesn't easily support this overlay-style interface.

*Workaround*: Use the Agenda view or database search to query and view properties.

* Export Limitations

** Visible-Only Export

In Emacs org-mode, you can export only the visible (non-folded) content using =C-c C-e= and selecting the "visible" scope.

*VS Code limitation*: The "visible" export option is defined but not yet implemented. VS Code's folding model is different from Emacs, making it difficult to determine what content is "visible".

*Workaround*: Use subtree export to export specific sections, or manually narrow your document.

** Additional Export Backends

The following org-mode export backends are not implemented:

| Backend     | Description                    | Alternative                    |
|-------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------|
| ODT         | LibreOffice/OpenDocument       | Export to HTML, convert        |
| ASCII       | Plain text export              | Export to Markdown             |
| Beamer      | LaTeX presentations            | Use standard LaTeX with Beamer |
| iCalendar   | Calendar export (.ics)         | Not available                  |
| Texinfo     | GNU documentation format       | Not available                  |
| man         | Unix manual pages              | Not available                  |

It is possible to develop new export backends.

* Babel/Code Execution Limitations

** Unsupported Languages

The following org-babel languages are not yet implemented:

- Ruby
- Perl
- C/C++
- Go
- Rust
- Gnuplot
- Ditaa (ASCII diagrams)
- Dot/Graphviz
- Octave/MATLAB
- LaTeX (as executable blocks)
- Haskell
- Clojure
- Scheme/Racket

*Workaround*: Use Jupyter kernels where available (e.g., =jupyter-rust=, =jupyter-go=).

** Emacs Lisp Execution

Emacs Lisp (=elisp=) blocks have only stub support since there's no Emacs Lisp interpreter in VS Code.

*Workaround*: None for elisp-specific code. Consider porting logic to JavaScript/TypeScript.

** Error Line Jumping

In scimax, clicking on error messages in results jumps to the corresponding line in the source block.

*VS Code limitation*: Not implemented.

* Agenda Limitations

** Custom Agenda Views

Emacs org-agenda supports highly customizable agenda views with complex matching criteria, custom sorting, and display options via =org-agenda-custom-commands=.

*VS Code limitation*: Only basic agenda views (day/week/month, TODO list, tag filter) are supported.

*Workaround*: Use database search with custom queries for complex filtering.

** Agenda Follow Mode

In Emacs, =org-agenda-follow-mode= shows the corresponding org file location as you move through agenda items.

*VS Code limitation*: Not implemented as a live-updating side-by-side view.

*Workaround*: Click on agenda items to navigate to their location.

* Other Limitations

** Org-Crypt (Encryption)

Emacs org-mode supports encrypting subtrees with GPG via =org-crypt=.

*VS Code limitation*: Not implemented.

** Org-Attach (Attachments)

The =org-attach= system for managing file attachments to headlines is not implemented.

*Workaround*: Use regular file links and organize attachments manually.

** Radio Targets

Radio targets (=<<<target>>>=) that automatically create links throughout the document are not supported.

** Footnote Renumbering

Automatic footnote renumbering (=org-footnote-renumber-fn:N=) is not implemented.

** Speed Keys Customization

While speed commands are implemented, the set of available commands is fixed and cannot be customized like in Emacs.

** Macros

Org-mode macros (={{{macro(args)}}}=) are parsed but have limited expansion support.

* Platform Differences

These are not bugs but fundamental differences in how VS Code works compared to Emacs:

| Feature              | Emacs                   | VS Code                        |
|----------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------|
| Buffer model         | Indirect buffers        | Single file per editor         |
| Text properties      | Per-character overlays  | Decorations API (limited)      |
| Keyboard input       | Full control            | Limited by browser/Electron    |
| Modal editing        | Native support          | Via extensions only            |
| Extension language   | Emacs Lisp              | TypeScript/JavaScript          |
| Customization depth  | Everything customizable | Settings + extension API       |
