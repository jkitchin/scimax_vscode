* ✅ Overview
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 19:55]

The Scimax projectile system provides project-aware file management inspired by Emacs Projectile. It enables quick switching between projects, intelligent project detection, and project-scoped operations for efficient multi-project workflows.

** ✅ What is Projectile?
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 19:55]

Projectile is a project management system that:

- Automatically detects projects based on version control markers (=.git=), special files (=.projectile=), or manual registration
- Maintains a list of known projects with quick-switch capabilities
- Provides project-scoped file search and text search
- Remembers recently accessed projects
- Integrates with the notebook system for research project organization
- Tracks project metadata including type and last access time

Projects can be:

- *Git repositories*: Directories containing a =.git= folder
- *Projectile-marked*: Directories with a =.projectile= marker file
- *Manual projects*: Any directory you explicitly add to the project list

** ✅ Key Features
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 19:55]

- *Automatic Detection*: Discovers git repos and projectile-marked directories
- *Quick Switching*: Fast navigation between known projects with =C-c p p=
- *Project History*: Shows when each project was last opened
- *Batch Scanning*: Scan directories to discover multiple projects at once
- *File Finding*: Project-scoped file search with =C-c p f=
- *Text Search*: Search within project files with =C-c p s=
- *Tree View*: Sidebar showing all known projects with visual indicators
- *Cleanup Tools*: Remove non-existent projects from the list
- *Notebook Integration*: Works seamlessly with scimax-notebook for research projects

* ✅ Project Detection
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 19:55]

** Detection Methods

Scimax uses three methods to detect projects, in this priority order:

1. *Git Repositories*: Any directory containing a .git/ subdirectory
2. *Projectile Markers*: Directories with a .projectile file
3. *Manual Registration*: Projects you explicitly add via commands

** Automatic Detection

When you open a workspace folder, Scimax automatically registers it as a project:

#+begin_example
# Opening a folder registers it automatically
$ code /home/user/my-project/

# The folder is now in your project list
# Type: git (if it has .git) or manual (otherwise)
#+end_example

** Creating a Projectile Marker

To mark a directory as a projectile project, create an empty =.projectile= file in the root:

#+begin_src sh
# Create marker file
touch .projectile

# Now Scimax recognizes this as a project
#+end_src

The =.projectile= file can be empty or contain patterns for ignoring files (reserved for future use).

** Project Types

Projects are classified into three types:

| Type         | Marker        | Icon         | Description                         |
|--------------+---------------+--------------+-------------------------------------|
| =git=        | =.git/=       | Git branch   | Git repository                      |
| =projectile= | =.projectile= | File icon    | Marked with .projectile file        |
| =manual=     | (none)        | Folder icon  | Manually added directory            |

The type is automatically detected when adding a project.

* Managing Projects

** Switching Between Projects

The primary projectile command is *Switch Project* (=C-c p p=):

#+begin_src
Command: Scimax: Switch Project
Keybinding: C-c p p
Hydra: Projects → p (Switch Project)
#+end_src

This opens a quick pick menu showing:

- Project name
- Full path
- Project type (git, projectile, or manual)
- Last opened time (e.g., "2h ago", "3d ago")

Select a project to choose how to open it:

| Option                 | Result                                      |
|------------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| New Window             | Opens project in a new VS Code window       |
| Current Window         | Replaces current workspace with project     |
| Add to Workspace       | Adds project to current multi-root workspace |

Example workflow:

#+begin_example
1. Press C-c p p
2. Type to filter: "scimax"
3. Select "scimax_vscode"
4. Choose "New Window"
→ Project opens in new VS Code window
→ Last opened time is updated
#+end_example

** Adding Projects

*** Manually Adding a Project

Use =Scimax: Add Project= (=C-c p a=):

#+begin_src
Command: Scimax: Add Project
Keybinding: C-c p a
Hydra: Projects → a (Add Project)
#+end_src

This opens a folder picker. Select any directory to add it to your project list.

#+begin_example
1. Press C-c p a
2. Navigate to /home/user/projects/my-app/
3. Select folder
→ "Added project: my-app"
→ Project appears in the list
#+end_example

*** Scanning for Projects

To discover multiple projects at once, use =Scimax: Scan Directory for Projects=:

#+begin_src
Command: Scimax: Scan Directory for Projects
Keybinding: (none)
Hydra: Projects → s (Scan for Projects)
#+end_src

Scanning process:

1. Select a parent directory to scan
2. Enter maximum depth (default: 2 levels deep)
3. Scimax searches for git repos and .projectile markers
4. Found projects are added automatically

Example:

#+begin_example
Scan directory: /home/user/projects/
Max depth: 2

# Finds and adds:
/home/user/projects/project-a/         (git)
/home/user/projects/project-b/         (git)
/home/user/projects/work/client-site/  (git)
/home/user/projects/notes/journal/     (projectile)

Result: "Found 4 projects"
#+end_example

The scanner:
- Skips hidden directories (starting with =.=)
- Stops descending into detected projects
- Handles permission errors gracefully
- Shows progress notification

** Removing Projects

Remove projects from the list with =Scimax: Remove Project=:

#+begin_src
Command: Scimax: Remove Project
Keybinding: (none)
Hydra: Projects → r (Remove Project)
#+end_src

Notes:
- This removes the project from the *known projects list only*
- It does *not* delete any files from disk
- The project can be re-added at any time

** Cleaning Up Projects

Over time, projects may be moved or deleted. Use =Scimax: Cleanup Non-existent Projects=:

#+begin_src
Command: Scimax: Cleanup Non-existent Projects
Keybinding: (none)
#+end_src

This scans all known projects and removes entries for directories that no longer exist on disk.

#+begin_example
Known projects: 15
Checking each path...
Removed: /home/user/old-project (not found)
Removed: /tmp/temp-project (not found)
Result: "Cleaned up 2 non-existent projects"
#+end_example

Run this periodically to keep your project list clean.

* Project Operations

** Finding Files in Projects

Find files within the current project using =Scimax: Find File in Project= (=C-c p f=):

#+begin_src
Command: Scimax: Find File in Project
Keybinding: C-c p f
Hydra: Projects → f (Find File)
#+end_src

This delegates to VS Code's built-in quick open (=C-p=), which automatically scopes to workspace folders.

Features:
- Fuzzy matching (e.g., "orgpar" matches "orgParser.ts")
- Recent files appear first
- Respects .gitignore and VS Code ignore patterns
- Fast indexing with intelligent caching

Example:

#+begin_example
C-c p f
Type: "babelProv"
→ Matches: src/org/babelProvider.ts
→ Press Enter to open
#+end_example

** Searching in Projects

Search for text within project files using =Scimax: Search in Project= (=C-c p s=):

#+begin_src
Command: Scimax: Search in Project
Keybinding: C-c p s
Hydra: Projects → g (Search in Project)
#+end_src

This opens VS Code's search panel pre-scoped to the current workspace.

Search features:
- Regular expression support
- Case sensitivity toggle
- Whole word matching
- Include/exclude file patterns
- Replace across all matches

Example workflow:

#+begin_example
1. Press C-c p s
2. Search panel opens
3. Enter search: "executeSourceBlock"
4. Results show all matches in project
5. Click to navigate to each match
#+end_example

** Opening Project Root

Navigate to the project root in the file explorer with =Scimax: Open Project Root= (=C-c p d=):

#+begin_src
Command: Scimax: Open Project Root
Keybinding: C-c p d
Hydra: (none)
#+end_src

For multi-root workspaces, you'll be asked to select which project root to reveal.

** Project Information

View details about the current project with =Scimax: Project Info=:

#+begin_src
Command: Scimax: Project Info
Keybinding: (none)
#+end_src

Displays:
- Project name
- Full path
- Project type (git, projectile, manual)
- Last opened timestamp
- Whether it's tracked by projectile

Example output:

#+begin_example
Name: scimax_vscode
Path: /home/user/scimax_vscode
Type: git
Last opened: 2026-01-13 14:32:15
#+end_example

* Projects Tree View

** Sidebar Panel

The Projects tree view appears in the Scimax sidebar, showing all known projects.

To open the sidebar:

#+begin_src
View → Open View... → Scimax Projects
#+end_src

** Tree View Elements

Each project in the tree shows:

- *Icon*:
  - 🟢 Open folder icon (green) = currently open project
  - Git branch icon = git repository
  - File icon = projectile-marked project
  - Folder icon = manual project

- *Name*: Project directory name

- *Description*:
  - "● current" for the active project
  - Relative time (e.g., "2h ago", "3d ago") for recent projects
  - Empty for never-opened projects

** Tree Interactions

Click a project to open it:
- Same behavior as =C-c p p= (Switch Project)
- Choose New Window, Current Window, or Add to Workspace

Right-click (context menu) actions:
- Refresh tree view
- Remove project
- Show project info

** Refreshing the Tree

The tree auto-refreshes when:
- Projects are added or removed
- Workspace folders change
- Projects are accessed (last opened time updates)

Manual refresh:

#+begin_src
Command: Scimax: Refresh Projects
Icon: Refresh button in tree view toolbar
#+end_src

* Recent Projects

** Sorting by Last Access

Projects are sorted by last opened time, with the most recently accessed appearing first:

#+begin_example
Project List:
1. scimax_vscode        (just now)     # ← Currently open
2. my-research          (2h ago)       # ← Recently used
3. client-website       (3d ago)
4. old-notes            (2024-11-15)   # ← Long time ago
#+end_example

This ordering makes it quick to switch back to recently used projects.

** Automatic Time Tracking

Last opened time is updated automatically when:

- Opening a project via =C-c p p= (Switch Project)
- Clicking a project in the tree view
- Opening a workspace folder that's a known project

The timestamp is stored in VS Code's global state, persisting across sessions.

** Time Format

Relative times are shown for recent access:

| Time Difference | Format         | Example    |
|-----------------+----------------+------------|
| < 1 minute      | "just now"     | just now   |
| < 60 minutes    | minutes ago    | 23m ago    |
| < 24 hours      | hours ago      | 5h ago     |
| < 30 days       | days ago       | 12d ago    |
| ≥ 30 days       | date           | 11/23/2024 |

* Commands Reference

** All Projectile Commands

| Command                                    | Keybinding | Hydra Key | Description                      |
|--------------------------------------------+------------+-----------+----------------------------------|
| =Scimax: Switch Project=                   | =C-c p p=  | p         | Switch to another project        |
| =Scimax: Find File in Project=             | =C-c p f=  | f         | Find file in current project     |
| =Scimax: Search in Project=                | =C-c p s=  | g         | Search text in project           |
| =Scimax: Open Project Root=                | =C-c p d=  |           | Reveal project root in explorer  |
| =Scimax: Add Project=                      | =C-c p a=  | a         | Add folder to project list       |
| =Scimax: Remove Project=                   |            | r         | Remove project from list         |
| =Scimax: Scan Directory for Projects=      |            | s         | Find projects in directory       |
| =Scimax: Project Info=                     |            |           | Show current project details     |
| =Scimax: Cleanup Non-existent Projects=    |            |           | Remove invalid project entries   |
| =Scimax: Refresh Projects=                 |            |           | Refresh tree view                |

** Keybindings

All projectile keybindings use the =C-c C-p= prefix, matching Emacs Projectile conventions:

#+begin_src
C-c p p    Switch project
C-c p f    Find file
C-c p s    Search in project
C-c p d    Open project root (directory)
C-c p a    Add project
#+end_src

These bindings work in all editors, regardless of file type.

** Hydra Menu Access

Open the Projects hydra menu:

#+begin_src
1. Open main hydra: C-c h (or Command Palette → Scimax: Hydra Menu)
2. Press 'p' for Projects
#+end_src

The hydra shows all projectile commands with single-key access:

#+begin_example
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Projects (Projectile)               │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Switch                              │
│  p  Switch Project                  │
│                                     │
│ Manage                              │
│  a  Add Project                     │
│  r  Remove Project                  │
│  s  Scan for Projects               │
│                                     │
│ Files                               │
│  f  Find File                       │
│  g  Search in Project               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
#+end_example

* Integration with Notebook System

** Notebook-Projectile Relationship

The notebook and projectile systems work together:

- *Notebooks are projects*: Creating a notebook automatically creates a =.projectile= marker
- *Projects can be notebooks*: Any project can have a =.scimax/= directory to become a notebook
- *Shared markers*: Both systems recognize =.projectile= files
- *Unified workflow*: Switch projects with projectile, manage research structure with notebooks

** Creating Projectile-Enabled Notebooks

When you create a notebook with =Scimax: New Notebook=:

#+begin_src org
my-notebook/
├── .scimax/
│   └── config.json        # Notebook metadata
├── .projectile            # ← Projectile marker (auto-created)
├── .git/                  # Optional: if "Initialize Git" was checked
└── README.org
#+end_src

The notebook is automatically:
1. Added to the projectile projects list
2. Detected as type "projectile" (or "git" if git was initialized)
3. Available via =C-c p p= for quick switching

** Converting Projects to Notebooks

Convert any existing project into a notebook:

#+begin_src
1. Open the project
2. Run: Scimax: New Notebook
3. Choose the project directory as the location
→ Adds .scimax/ configuration
→ Project becomes a full notebook with metadata
#+end_src

The project remains in your projectile list and gains notebook features:
- Master file tracking
- Collaborator management
- Notebook-scoped agenda
- Archive capabilities

** Notebook Metadata in Projects

Notebooks store additional metadata in =.scimax/config.json=:

#+begin_src json
{
  "name": "Research Project",
  "description": "My research on topic X",
  "masterFile": "README.org",
  "collaborators": [
    {
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "email": "jane@example.com",
      "role": "lead"
    }
  ],
  "keywords": ["research", "machine-learning"],
  "custom": {
    "grant": "NSF-12345"
  }
}
#+end_src

This metadata is available to both systems:
- Projectile shows the project in its list
- Notebook commands provide research-specific features

** Workflow Example: Research Projects

Typical workflow for managing multiple research projects:

#+begin_example
# Create notebooks for each research topic
Scimax: New Notebook → "ml-experiments"
Scimax: New Notebook → "paper-writing"
Scimax: New Notebook → "data-analysis"

# Each is now in projectile list
C-c p p → Shows all three projects

# Quick switching between research
C-c p p → ml-experiments → open README.org
  (run experiments, update notes)
C-c p p → paper-writing → edit paper.org
  (write, cite references)
C-c p p → data-analysis → explore data/
  (analyze results)

# Search across specific project
C-c p s → "neural network" → find all mentions
#+end_example

The integration provides:
- Fast project switching (projectile)
- Organized research structure (notebook)
- Project-scoped search and navigation
- Consistent marker files

* Best Practices

** Project Organization

*** Use Consistent Markers

Choose one marker style per project:

- Git projects: Let =.git/= serve as the marker
- Non-git projects: Add =.projectile= explicitly
- Notebooks: Use notebook creation (adds both =.projectile= and =.scimax/=)

*** Project Naming

Use descriptive, scannable directory names:

#+begin_example
Good:
  my-research-project/
  client-website-2024/
  ml-experiments/

Less good:
  proj1/
  tmp/
  stuff/
#+end_example

Project names appear in the quick pick list, so clarity helps with quick selection.

*** Directory Structure

Organize related projects together:

#+begin_example
~/projects/
  ├── research/
  │   ├── ml-experiments/
  │   ├── data-analysis/
  │   └── paper-writing/
  ├── work/
  │   ├── client-a/
  │   └── client-b/
  └── personal/
      ├── blog/
      └── dotfiles/
#+end_example

Use =Scimax: Scan Directory for Projects= on parent directories to bulk-add.

** Efficient Workflows

*** Quick Switching Pattern

Develop muscle memory for =C-c p p=:

#+begin_example
C-c p p → type few chars → Enter → choose window option
# Takes ~2 seconds to switch projects
#+end_example

This is faster than:
- File → Open Folder → navigate → select
- Clicking through GUI menus

*** Recent Project Access

The most recent 3-5 projects appear at the top of the list. Use this for:

#+begin_example
Morning: Open project A (becomes #1)
Afternoon: Switch to project B (becomes #1, A becomes #2)
Evening: Back to A (already #2, quick to select)
#+end_example

*** Search Before Switching

If you know what file you need:

#+begin_example
1. C-c p p → select project
2. C-c p f → find file
3. Start working

# Faster than navigating manually
#+end_example

** Maintenance

*** Regular Cleanup

Run cleanup monthly:

#+begin_src
Scimax: Cleanup Non-existent Projects
#+end_src

This prevents clutter from:
- Deleted temporary projects
- Moved directories
- External drive projects (when unmounted)

*** Curate Your List

Remove projects you no longer use:

- Old experiments
- Completed client work
- Temporary test projects

A smaller project list means faster selection in =C-c p p=.

*** Backup Project List

The project list is stored in VS Code's global state. To backup:

#+begin_src sh
# Find VS Code's storage location
# Linux: ~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/
# macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/
# Windows: %APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage\

# Project list is in state.vscdb
# Backup this file to preserve project list
#+end_src

** Multi-Root Workspaces

*** When to Use Multi-Root

Use multi-root workspaces for:

- Related projects that share context
- Monorepo management
- Cross-project refactoring

Example:

#+begin_example
Workspace: "Full Stack App"
  Folders:
    - frontend/  (React app)
    - backend/   (Node API)
    - shared/    (TypeScript types)

Benefits:
  - Search across all three
  - Shared settings
  - Unified git operations
#+end_example

*** When to Use Separate Windows

Use separate windows for:

- Unrelated projects
- Context switching between different work modes
- Performance with large projects

Example:

#+begin_example
Window 1: Research project (Jupyter, org files)
Window 2: Client website (HTML, CSS, JS)
Window 3: Personal blog (Markdown, static site)

Benefits:
  - Mental separation
  - Independent configurations
  - Clearer taskbar
#+end_example

* Advanced Usage

** Custom Project Markers

While =.projectile= is the standard marker, you can manually add any directory:

#+begin_src
Scimax: Add Project → select any folder
#+end_src

Use this for:
- Projects without version control
- Shared network directories
- Temporary project workspaces

** Scanning Large Directories

When scanning directories with many subdirectories:

#+begin_example
Directory: ~/dev/ (contains 100+ repos)
Max depth: 1

# Only scans immediate children
# Fast, finds top-level projects
#+end_example

#+begin_example
Directory: ~/dev/
Max depth: 3

# Scans deeper
# Slower, finds nested projects
# Useful for monorepos or organized hierarchies
#+end_example

Balance depth vs. speed based on your directory structure.

** Project Type Prioritization

If a directory has multiple markers:

#+begin_example
my-project/
  ├── .git/          # Git marker
  └── .projectile    # Projectile marker

Type: git (git takes priority)
#+end_example

Priority order:
1. =.git/= → type "git"
2. =.projectile= → type "projectile"
3. Manual add → type "manual"

This ensures git projects are recognized as such, even if they also have =.projectile= markers.

** Programmatic Access

Other extensions can access the projectile manager:

#+begin_src typescript
// Get the projectile manager from extension context
const scimaxExt = vscode.extensions.getExtension('scimax.scimax-vscode');
if (scimaxExt?.isActive) {
    const api = scimaxExt.exports;
    const projects = api.projectileManager.getProjects();
    // Use project list...
}
#+end_src

This enables:
- Custom project selection UIs
- Integration with external tools
- Automated project management

* Troubleshooting

** Projects Not Appearing

*** Symptom
Project doesn't appear in =C-c p p= list.

*** Solutions

1. Check if directory exists:
   #+begin_src sh
   ls -la /path/to/project
   #+end_src

2. Manually add the project:
   #+begin_src
   Scimax: Add Project → select directory
   #+end_src

3. Check for markers:
   #+begin_src sh
   cd /path/to/project
   ls -la | grep -E '\.git|\.projectile'
   #+end_src

4. Run cleanup to remove stale entries:
   #+begin_src
   Scimax: Cleanup Non-existent Projects
   #+end_src

** Project List Too Long

*** Symptom
=C-c p p= shows dozens of old projects.

*** Solutions

1. Remove unused projects individually:
   #+begin_src
   Scimax: Remove Project → select each
   #+end_src

2. Clean up non-existent projects:
   #+begin_src
   Scimax: Cleanup Non-existent Projects
   #+end_src

3. Start fresh:
   #+begin_src
   # Clear global state (requires extension reload)
   # Open VS Code settings JSON
   # Remove scimax.projects entry
   #+end_src

** Tree View Not Updating

*** Symptom
Projects tree shows outdated information.

*** Solutions

1. Manual refresh:
   #+begin_src
   Scimax: Refresh Projects
   # Or click refresh icon in tree view toolbar
   #+end_src

2. Close and reopen sidebar:
   #+begin_src
   View → Close Sidebar
   View → Open View → Scimax Projects
   #+end_src

3. Reload window:
   #+begin_src
   Developer: Reload Window
   #+end_src

** Scanning Not Finding Projects

*** Symptom
=Scimax: Scan Directory for Projects= reports "Found 0 projects".

*** Solutions

1. Increase scan depth:
   #+begin_example
   Try depth 2, 3, or 4
   #+end_example

2. Check directory structure:
   #+begin_src sh
   # Find git repos manually
   find /path/to/scan -name .git -type d
   #+end_src

3. Manually add projects:
   #+begin_src
   Scimax: Add Project
   #+end_src

4. Verify permissions:
   #+begin_src sh
   # Ensure you have read access to directories
   ls -la /path/to/scan
   #+end_src

** Slow Project Operations

*** Symptom
=C-c p p= or tree view is slow to load.

*** Causes & Solutions

1. *Too many projects*:
   - Remove unused projects
   - Run cleanup command

2. *Network drives*:
   - Projects on network shares are slower
   - Consider removing or using local copies

3. *Deep scanning*:
   - Reduce max depth when scanning
   - Use depth 1-2 for most use cases

4. *Large project count*:
   - Keep project list under 50-100 entries
   - Archive old projects

* Comparison with Emacs Projectile

For users familiar with Emacs Projectile:

** Similarities

| Emacs Projectile           | Scimax VS Code          | Notes                           |
|----------------------------+-------------------------+---------------------------------|
| =C-c p p= switch           | =C-c p p= switch        | Same keybinding                 |
| =C-c p f= find file        | =C-c p f= find file     | Delegates to VS Code picker     |
| =C-c p s= search           | =C-c p s= search        | Opens VS Code search panel      |
| =.projectile= marker       | =.projectile= marker    | Compatible format               |
| Git detection              | Git detection           | Automatic                       |
| Recent projects            | Recent projects         | Sorted by last accessed         |
| Project types              | Project types           | git/projectile/manual           |

** Differences

*** File Finding
- *Emacs*: Custom projectile completion
- *VS Code*: Uses built-in Quick Open (=C-p=)
- *Advantage*: VS Code's picker is faster and more familiar

*** Search
- *Emacs*: helm-projectile or ivy integration
- *VS Code*: Uses built-in Search panel
- *Advantage*: VS Code's search is more visual with inline results

*** Project Caching
- *Emacs*: Caches project file lists
- *VS Code*: Uses VS Code's file indexing
- *Advantage*: Automatic, no manual cache management

*** Buffer Management
- *Emacs*: =C-c C-p b= switch buffer within project
- *VS Code*: Not needed (tabs and Quick Open serve this role)

*** Project Commands
- *Emacs*: Many specialized commands (=C-c C-p c= compile, =C-c C-p t= test)
- *VS Code*: Fewer commands, uses VS Code's task system instead

** Migration Tips

If migrating from Emacs Projectile:

1. *Muscle memory*: Core keybindings (=C-c p p=, =C-c p f=, =C-c p s=) are the same
2. *Markers*: Your =.projectile= files work without changes
3. *Workflows*: File finding and search feel similar but use VS Code UI
4. *Project list*: Use =Scimax: Scan Directory for Projects= to import existing projects
5. *Customization*: VS Code settings replace most projectile variables

* Configuration

Projectile settings in VS Code settings (=settings.json=):

** No Configuration Required

Projectile works out-of-the-box with no configuration. The extension:

- Automatically detects current workspace folders
- Persists project list in global state
- Uses sensible defaults for all operations

** Future Configuration Options

Potential future settings (not currently implemented):

#+begin_src json
{
  // Default depth for scanning directories
  "scimax.projectile.scanDepth": 2,

  // Auto-scan directories on startup
  "scimax.projectile.autoScan": false,

  // Paths to scan for projects
  "scimax.projectile.scanPaths": [
    "~/projects/",
    "~/dev/"
  ],

  // Max number of recent projects to show
  "scimax.projectile.maxRecentProjects": 50
}
#+end_src

Note: These settings are planned but not yet available. Check extension documentation for current configuration options.

* Conclusion

The Scimax projectile system brings Emacs-style project management to VS Code, enabling:

- Fast switching between projects with familiar keybindings
- Intelligent automatic detection of git repos and marked directories
- Project-scoped file finding and text search
- Integration with the notebook system for research workflows
- Visual project management through the tree view sidebar

Whether you're managing multiple research projects, client work, or personal repositories, projectile streamlines your workflow by keeping all your projects accessible with a few keystrokes.

** Next Steps

- Create a =.projectile= marker in your important projects
- Use =C-c p p= to build muscle memory for project switching
- Scan your development directory to populate the project list
- Explore integration with notebooks for research projects
- Set up keybindings for your most-used projectile commands
