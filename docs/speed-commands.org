*Keybinding Note:* This extension uses Emacs-style keybindings where Ctrl is used on all platforms (not Cmd on Mac), except where explicitly noted. Mac alternatives are shown as Cmd where applicable.

* ✅ Introduction
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:44]

Speed commands are single-letter keyboard shortcuts that work when the cursor is positioned at the very beginning (column 0) of a heading line. This feature, borrowed from Emacs org-mode, provides lightning-fast navigation and editing without the need for complex key chords.

** ✅ What are Speed Commands?
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:44]

Speed commands transform the beginning of each heading into a powerful command interface. When your cursor is at column 0 of a heading (the first star ~*~ in org-mode or the first hash ~#~ in markdown), you can press a single key to execute common operations:

- Navigation: jump between headings, siblings, parent
- Visibility: fold/unfold sections
- Structure editing: move, promote, demote, cut, paste
- TODO management: cycle states, set priorities
- Planning: add schedules and deadlines
- Metadata: set tags, properties, effort estimates
- Time tracking: clock in and out
- Archiving: archive completed tasks

This approach is significantly faster than using traditional keybindings or menu commands for frequent operations.

** ✅ Why Use Speed Commands?
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:44]

- *Efficiency*: Single keystrokes instead of multi-key combinations
- *Contextual*: Only active at heading starts, so no conflicts with normal typing
- *Discoverable*: Press ~?~ at a heading start to see all available commands
- *Emacs-compatible*: Familiar workflow for Emacs org-mode users

* ✅ Configuration

** ✅ Enabling Speed Commands
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:44]

Speed commands are enabled by default in Scimax VS Code. To toggle them on or off:

*** ✅ Via Settings UI
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:44]

1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl+, or Cmd+, on Mac)
2. Search for "speed commands"
3. Toggle the checkbox for *Scimax: Speed Commands > Enabled*

*** ✅ Via settings.json
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:45]

Add or modify this setting in your ~settings.json~:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "scimax.speedCommands.enabled": true
}
#+END_SRC

*** ✅ Via Command Palette
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:45]

1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
2. Type "speed" and select *Scimax: Toggle Speed Commands*

** ✅ Supported File Types
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:45]

Speed commands work in:
- Org-mode files (~.org~)
- Markdown files (~.md~, ~.markdown~)

* ✅ When Speed Commands are Active
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:45]

Speed commands are only active when *all* of the following conditions are met:

1. *Speed commands are enabled* in settings (~scimax.speedCommands.enabled: true~)
2. *Cursor is at column 0* (the very beginning of the line)
3. *Line is a heading* (starts with ~*~ for org-mode or ~#~ for markdown)
4. *No text is selected* (cursor position only, not a selection)

** ✅ Visual Indicator
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:45]

When speed commands are active, you'll notice that single key presses trigger actions immediately. If speed commands aren't working:

1. Check that your cursor is at position 0 (before the first ~*~ or ~#~)
2. Ensure no text is selected
3. Verify the file type is org or markdown
4. Check settings to confirm speed commands are enabled

* ✅ Speed Command Reference
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:45]

- ~projects.org~ → ~projects_archive.org~

The archived subtree is tagged with ~:ARCHIVE:~ and includes metadata:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
* DONE Completed project :ARCHIVE:
:PROPERTIES:
:ARCHIVE_TIME: [2026-01-13 Mon 15:30]
:ARCHIVE_FILE: ~/org/projects.org
:END:

CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

** ✅ Learning the Commands
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

1. *Start with navigation*: ~n~, ~p~, ~f~, ~b~, ~u~ are the most frequently used
2. *Use the help*: Press ~?~ at any heading start to see all commands
3. *Muscle memory*: The keys are mnemonic:
   - ~n~ = next, ~p~ = previous, ~f~ = forward, ~b~ = backward
   - ~u~ = up (parent)
   - ~t~ = TODO, ~s~ = schedule, ~d~ = deadline
   - ~I~/~O~ = In/Out (clocking)
   - ~l~/~r~ = left/right (promote/demote)

** ✅ Common Workflows
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

*** ✅ Quick Task Management
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

1. Create heading with ~Ctrl+Enter~
2. Move to beginning of line (~Home~ or ~Ctrl+A~)
3. Press ~t~ to add TODO state
4. Press ~1~ to set high priority
5. Press ~s~ to schedule it
6. Press ~:~ to add tags

*** ✅ Organizing Content
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

1. Navigate to a heading
2. Use ~U~/~D~ to reorder siblings
3. Use ~l~/~r~ to adjust hierarchy
4. Use ~w~ to cut and ~y~ to paste sections
5. Use ~a~ to archive completed work

*** ✅ Reviewing Documents
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

1. Press ~o~ to see overview (all headings folded)
2. Use ~n~/~p~ to navigate between sections
3. Press ~Tab~ to expand interesting sections
4. Press ~c~ to cycle through visibility levels

** ✅ Combining with Regular Keybindings
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

Speed commands complement (don't replace) regular keybindings:

- Use speed commands for quick operations when cursor is at heading start
- Use regular keybindings (~Ctrl+C Ctrl+T~, etc.) when cursor is elsewhere
- Use ~Ctrl+A~ or ~Home~ to quickly jump to column 0 to activate speed commands

** ✅ Cursor Position Matters
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

Remember: speed commands *only* work at column 0. If a speed command doesn't trigger:

1. Press ~Home~ or ~Ctrl+A~ to move to beginning of line
2. Verify you're on a heading line (starts with ~*~ or ~#~)
3. Check that no text is selected

** ✅ Customization
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:50]

Currently, speed command keys are pre-defined and cannot be customized. The key mappings follow standard Emacs org-mode conventions for consistency and muscle memory compatibility.

If you need custom keybindings, use VS Code's keybinding system to bind the underlying commands (e.g., ~scimax.org.nextHeading~, ~scimax.org.cycleTodo~) to your preferred key combinations.
