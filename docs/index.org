* Scimax VS Code

Scimax VS Code is a comprehensive scientific computing extension for Visual
Studio Code, inspired by the powerful [[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax][Scimax]] package for Emacs. It brings
literate programming, knowledge management, and scientific writing capabilities
to VS Code users.

** What is Scimax VS Code?

Scimax VS Code transforms Visual Studio Code into a powerful environment for:

- *Literate Programming* - Write documents that combine prose and executable code
- *Scientific Computing* - Execute code in 30+ languages with Jupyter integration
- *Knowledge Management* - Organize notes, tasks, and references in structured documents
- *Academic Writing* - Manage citations, export to LaTeX/PDF, and write papers

The extension provides first-class support for org-mode files (.org), with
additional support for Markdown documents.

** Key Features

*** Document Structure

Create hierarchical documents with collapsible headings, properties, and tags.
Navigate efficiently with outline views, heading jumps, and fuzzy search.

- Unlimited heading levels with folding support
- Tags and inherited tags for organization
- Properties drawers for metadata
- Speed commands for rapid navigation

See [[file:document-structure.org][Document Structure]] for details.

   ,#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
   print("Hello, Scimax VS Code!")
   ,#+END_SRC
   #+END_SRC
   Press =Ctrl+Enter= or =Ctrl+C Ctrl+C= to execute.

5. *Explore the menus* with =Ctrl+C M= (main menu) or =Ctrl+C Ctrl+M= (context menu)

See [[file:getting-started.org][Getting Started]] for a complete introduction.
