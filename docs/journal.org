* Introduction

The Scimax Journal is a powerful date-based note-taking system that helps you maintain a daily journal, track your work, and build a personal knowledge base over time. Inspired by org-journal and bullet journaling, it provides a structured yet flexible way to capture thoughts, tasks, and logs throughout your day.

** Key Features

- Automatic date-based organization with hierarchical directory structure
- Multiple customizable templates for different journaling styles
- Built-in calendar view for visualizing and navigating entries
- Quick navigation between entries with keyboard shortcuts
- Full-text search across all journal entries
- Statistics tracking including writing streaks and word counts
- Quick capture for timestamped log entries
- Status bar integration showing current entry details
- Tree view for browsing entries by year, month, and day

** Philosophy

The journal system is designed around the principle of friction-free capture. With a single keyboard shortcut (=Ctrl+Shift+J=), you can open today's journal entry and start writing. The system handles all organization automatically, storing files in a sensible directory structure that mirrors the calendar.

* Getting Started

** Opening Your First Journal Entry

The quickest way to start journaling is to press =Ctrl+Shift+J= (=Cmd+Shift+J= on Mac). This will:

1. Create today's journal entry if it doesn't exist
2. Apply your default template
3. Open the file in the editor

Your first entry might look like this:

#+begin_src org
#+TITLE: 2026-01-14 - Tuesday
#+DATE: 2026-01-14

,* Tasks
- [ ]

,* Notes

,* Log
#+end_src

** Directory Structure

By default, journal entries are stored in =~/scimax-journal= with the following structure:

#+begin_example
~/scimax-journal/
├── 2026/
│   ├── 01/
│   │   ├── 14/
│   │   │   └── 2026-01-14.org
│   │   ├── 15/
│   │   │   └── 2026-01-15.org
│   │   └── 16/
│   │       └── 2026-01-16.org
│   └── 02/
│       └── 01/
│           └── 2026-02-01.org
└── .scimax/
    └── templates/
        ├── custom.org
        └── meeting.org
#+end_example

Each entry is stored in a path like =YYYY/MM/DD/YYYY-MM-DD.org=, making it easy to browse chronologically while keeping the directory structure manageable.

** Configuration

Configure the journal system through VS Code settings (=File > Preferences > Settings= or =Ctrl+,=):

*** scimax.journal.directory

Directory where journal files are stored. If empty, defaults to =~/scimax-journal=.

#+begin_src json
{
  "scimax.journal.directory": "~/Documents/journal"
}
#+end_src

You can also use absolute paths or paths starting with =~= for your home directory.

*** scimax.journal.format

Choose between org-mode or Markdown format for journal entries.

#+begin_src json
{
  "scimax.journal.format": "org"  // or "markdown"
}
#+end_src

Default: =org=

*** scimax.journal.template

The default template to use when creating new entries.

#+begin_src json
{
  "scimax.journal.template": "default"
}
#+end_src

Available built-in templates: =default=, =minimal=, =research=, =meeting=, =standup=

*** scimax.journal.dateFormat

Date format for file names (currently only =YYYY-MM-DD= is supported).

#+begin_src json
{
  "scimax.journal.dateFormat": "YYYY-MM-DD"
}
#+end_src

Default: =YYYY-MM-DD=

*** scimax.journal.autoTimestamp

Automatically add timestamps when using the quick log feature.

#+begin_src json
{
  "scimax.journal.autoTimestamp": true
}
#+end_src

Default: =true=

*** scimax.journal.weekStartsOn

First day of the week for calendar and week views.

#+begin_src json
{
  "scimax.journal.weekStartsOn": "monday"  // or "sunday"
}
#+end_src

Default: =monday=

* Journal Templates

Templates define the structure of new journal entries. Scimax provides several built-in templates and supports custom templates.

** Built-in Templates

*** default

,* Blockers
-
#+end_src

** Template Variables

Templates support the following variables that are automatically substituted:

| Variable        | Description                      | Example           |
|-----------------+----------------------------------+-------------------|
| ={{date}}=      | ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)            | 2026-01-14        |
| ={{year}}=      | Four-digit year                  | 2026              |
| ={{month}}=     | Two-digit month                  | 01                |
| ={{day}}=       | Two-digit day                    | 14                |
| ={{weekday}}=   | Day of week name                 | Tuesday           |
| ={{monthName}}= | Full month name                  | January           |
| ={{timestamp}}= | ISO timestamp                    | 2026-01-14T10:30Z |
| ={{author}}=    | Currently returns empty, reserved for future use | |

** Creating Custom Templates

Custom templates are stored in =<journal-directory>/.scimax/templates/=. Create a new template by:

1. Create the templates directory if it doesn't exist:
   #+begin_src bash
   mkdir -p ~/scimax-journal/.scimax/templates
   #+end_src

2. Create a template file with the same extension as your journal format (=.org= or =.md=):
   #+begin_src bash
   # For org-mode journals
   touch ~/scimax-journal/.scimax/templates/weekly-review.org
   #+end_src

3. Edit the template file with your desired structure:
   #+begin_src org
   #+TITLE: Weekly Review - {{date}}
   #+DATE: {{date}}

   ,* Week of {{date}}

   ,* Accomplishments
   - [ ]

   ,* Lessons Learned

   ,* Goals for Next Week
   - [ ]

   ,* Reflections
   #+end_src

4. Use the template when creating a new entry:
   - Run =Scimax: New Journal Entry= command
   - Select your custom template from the list

** Markdown Templates

If you configure the journal format as Markdown, the built-in templates use Markdown syntax:

#+begin_src markdown
# {{date}} - {{weekday}}

## Tasks
- [ ]

## Notes

## Log
#+end_src

Custom Markdown templates work the same way, but use the =.md= extension.

* Creating Journal Entries

** Today's Entry

Press =Ctrl+Shift+J= (=Cmd+Shift+J= on Mac) or run the command =Scimax: Open Today's Journal=.

This is the fastest way to start journaling. If today's entry doesn't exist, it will be created using your default template.

** New Entry for Any Date

To create an entry for a different date:

1. Run command: =Scimax: New Journal Entry=
2. Select a template
3. Enter a date in =YYYY-MM-DD= format (or leave empty for today)

If an entry already exists for that date, you'll be asked if you want to open it instead.

Example workflow for creating a meeting note:

1. =Ctrl+Shift+P= → =Scimax: New Journal Entry=
2. Select =meeting= template
3. Press Enter to use today's date
4. Entry is created and opened

** Using Different Templates

You can create multiple entries for the same date using different templates by:

1. Running =Scimax: New Journal Entry= multiple times
2. Selecting different templates each time

However, only one file per date is stored. To use multiple templates in one day, either:

- Merge content manually
- Use a comprehensive custom template
- Create separate files outside the journal system

* Navigating Journal Entries

** Keyboard Navigation

When viewing a journal entry:

- =Alt+[= - Go to previous entry
- =Alt+]= - Go to next entry

These shortcuts only work when the current file is a journal entry (filename matches =YYYY-MM-DD.org= or =.md=).

** Go to Specific Date

Run =Scimax: Go to Journal Date= to see a list of all your entries:

#+begin_example
> Scimax: Go to Journal Date

  📅 2026-01-14    Tue
  📅 2026-01-13    Mon
  📅 2026-01-12    Sun
  📅 2026-01-10    Fri
  ...
#+end_example

Use arrow keys or type to filter, then press Enter to open.

** Calendar View

The calendar view provides a visual way to navigate entries:

*** Accessing the Calendar

- Click on the Journal view in the Activity Bar (left sidebar)
- Or run: =Scimax: Show Journal Calendar=

*** Calendar Features

The calendar shows:

- Current month with clickable days
- Days with entries are highlighted
- Today is marked with a border
- Past days without entries are dimmed

Calendar controls:

- Click any day to open/create entry
- =← → buttons= - Navigate months
- =Today's Journal= button - Jump to today
- Month picker - Click month name to show month selector
- Year navigation - Click year buttons to jump years

*** Quick Actions in Calendar

At the bottom of the calendar view:

- =This Week= - Show this week's entries
- =Search= - Search journal entries
- =Stats= - Show journal statistics

** Tree View

The journal tree view (in the sidebar) shows entries organized by year and month:

#+begin_example
📁 2026 (45 entries)
  📁 January (15 entries)
    ⭐ 14 (Tue)    ← Today
    📄 13 (Mon)
    📄 12 (Sun)
  📁 December (30 entries)
    📄 31 (Wed)
    ...
📁 2025 (312 entries)
  ...
#+end_example

- Click any entry to open it
- Today's entry is marked with a star icon
- Entries are sorted with most recent first

** Week View

To see all entries for the current week:

Run =Scimax: This Week's Entries=

This shows a quick-pick list with:
- Each day of the current week that has an entry
- Word count for each entry
- Task completion statistics

#+begin_example
This week: 5 entries

📅 Tue 2026-01-14    450 words    3/5 tasks completed
📅 Mon 2026-01-13    320 words    5/5 tasks completed
📅 Sun 2026-01-12    280 words
...
#+end_example

* Searching Journal Entries

** Full-Text Search

Run =Scimax: Search Journal= to search your entries:

1. Select a date range:
   - All entries
   - This week
   - This month
   - This year

2. Enter your search term

3. Browse results showing:
   - Date of entry
   - Matching lines (up to 3 per entry)
   - Line numbers

4. Select a result to jump to that entry and line

Example search results:

#+begin_example
3 entries found for "machine learning"

📄 2026-01-14    ...worked on machine learning model...    Line 15
📄 2026-01-14    ...read about machine learning theory...   Line 28
📄 2026-01-10    ...machine learning paper review...        Line 12
#+end_example

** Search Tips

- Searches are case-insensitive
- Partial word matching is supported
- Search scans the entire content including headings and metadata
- Results are limited to preserve performance

** Advanced Search

For more advanced searching, you can use the global Scimax search commands which index all journal entries:

- =Scimax: Search All Files= - Full-text search with BM25 ranking
- =Scimax: Semantic Search= - AI-powered semantic search
- =Scimax: Search Headings= - Search only heading text

These commands search across your entire workspace, including journal entries.

* Quick Capture and Logging

** Quick Log Entry

The quick log feature lets you capture a timestamped note without opening a file:

1. Run =Scimax: Quick Log Entry= or create a custom keybinding
2. Type your note
3. Press Enter

The note is automatically appended to today's journal under the =* Log= section with a timestamp:

#+begin_src org
,* Log
- [14:30] Started work on documentation
- [15:45] Meeting with team about project timeline
- [16:20] Fixed bug in parser module
#+end_src

This is perfect for:
- Quick status updates
- Tracking interruptions
- Logging time-sensitive information
- Building a timeline of your day

** Insert Timestamp

When editing a journal entry, run =Scimax: Insert Timestamp= to insert a timestamp at the cursor:

Org format:
#+begin_example
[2026-01-14 10:30]
#+end_example

Markdown format:
#+begin_example
2026-01-14 10:30
#+end_example

Useful for:
- Manual time tracking
- Marking when you started/finished tasks
- Adding temporal context to notes

* Journal Statistics

** Viewing Statistics

Run =Scimax: Show Journal Statistics= to see:

#+begin_example
Total entries: 45 | Total words: 32,450 | Current streak: 7 days | Longest streak: 12 days
#+end_example

** Statistics Tracked

*** Entry Count
Total number of journal entries you've written.

*** Total Words
Combined word count across all entries. Only counts actual words, not markup.

*** Current Streak
Number of consecutive days you've written an entry (including today or ending yesterday).

*** Longest Streak
Your best streak of consecutive journaling days.

** Streak Calculation

A streak is maintained if you create entries on consecutive days:

- Writing today extends your streak
- Missing today but having written yesterday keeps the streak at yesterday's count
- Missing two days in a row breaks the streak

The streak counter helps build a journaling habit through positive reinforcement.

** Status Bar Integration

The status bar (bottom of window) shows journal information:

When viewing a journal entry:
#+begin_example
📓 Tue 01/14 | 450 words | 3/5 tasks
#+end_example

When viewing other files:
#+begin_example
📓 Journal | 7 day streak
#+end_example

Click the status bar item to quickly open today's journal.

Hover over it to see:
- Total entries
- Total words
- Quick link to today's entry

* Integration with Other Features

** Agenda Integration

Journal entries are automatically indexed by the Scimax database if your journal directory is included in the search scope.

This means journal entries with TODO items, scheduled items, and deadlines will appear in:

- =Scimax: Show Agenda= - Daily agenda view
- =Scimax: Show TODO Items= - All TODO items
- =Scimax: Show Upcoming Deadlines= - Deadline tracking

To ensure journal integration:

1. Open settings
2. Add your journal directory to =scimax.db.directories=:

#+begin_src json
{
  "scimax.db.directories": [
    "~/scimax-journal"
  ]
}
#+end_src

3. Run =Scimax: Reindex Files=

Now you can use journal entries for task management with full agenda support.

** Cross-Referencing

Use org-mode links to cross-reference between journal entries:

#+begin_src org
,* Follow-up from yesterday

See [[file:2026/01/13/2026-01-13.org::*Meeting Notes][yesterday's meeting notes]] for context.
#+end_src

Or use relative paths:

#+begin_src org
[[file:../13/2026-01-13.org][Previous entry]]
#+end_src

** Embedding Code Blocks

Journal entries support full Babel functionality. Execute code blocks directly in your journal:

#+begin_src org
,* Analysis for Today

,#+begin_src python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('daily_metrics.csv')
print(data.describe())
,#+end_src
#+end_src

Press =Ctrl+Enter= (=Cmd+Enter= on Mac) to execute blocks.

See [[file:source-blocks.org][Source Blocks documentation]] for details.

** Citations and References

Use org-ref features to add citations to journal entries:

#+begin_src org
,* Reading Notes

Read interesting paper about neural networks cite:lecun2015deep.
The architecture described in cite:he2016deep could be useful for our project.

,* References
bibliography:~/references.bib
#+end_src

Press =Ctrl+C ]= to insert citations.

See [[file:references.org][References documentation]] for details.

* Tips and Best Practices

** Daily Journaling Workflow

1. *Morning*: Open today's journal (=Ctrl+Shift+J=), review yesterday's entry (=Alt+[=), plan today's tasks
2. *Throughout the day*: Use quick log (=Scimax: Quick Log Entry=) to capture notes
3. *Evening*: Review entry, mark tasks complete, add reflections
4. *Weekly*: Use =This Week's Entries= to review the week

** Building the Habit

- Set a reminder to journal at the same time each day
- Start small - even a single sentence counts
- Watch your streak grow for motivation
- Use the minimal template if the default feels overwhelming
- Pin the Journal tree view for easy access

** Organizing Information

- Use consistent heading structures for easier searching
- Tag entries with hashtags: =#projectname= =#meeting= =#idea=
- Link related entries together
- Use the Log section for quick captures, Notes for longer form
- Create custom templates for recurring entry types

** Performance Tips

- The journal system caches entries for 30 seconds, so browsing is fast
- Large journals (1000+ entries) may take a moment to load the tree view
- Search is optimized but searching "all entries" on large journals may be slow
- Statistics are cached for 1 minute and updated asynchronously

** Backup and Sync

Since journal entries are plain text files in a standard directory structure:

- Easy to backup with any file backup system
- Can sync via Dropbox, iCloud, or git
- Simple to migrate or export
- Future-proof format (plain text)

Example git setup for version control:

#+begin_src bash
cd ~/scimax-journal
git init
echo ".scimax/cache" > .gitignore
git add .
git commit -m "Initial journal"
#+end_src

Then periodically:

#+begin_src bash
cd ~/scimax-journal
git add .
git commit -m "Journal updates $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
git push
#+end_src

** Privacy and Security

Journal entries are stored as plain text on your local filesystem. For sensitive information:

- Encrypt your journal directory using OS-level encryption
- Use a private git repository if syncing
- Consider using org-crypt for encrypting specific entries
- Be mindful of what you commit to version control

* Troubleshooting

** Journal Directory Not Found

If you see errors about missing directory:

1. Check =scimax.journal.directory= setting
2. Ensure the parent directory exists
3. Restart VS Code
4. The directory will be created automatically on first use

** Templates Not Working

If custom templates aren't appearing:

1. Verify template location: =<journal-directory>/.scimax/templates/=
2. Check file extension matches format (=.org= for org-mode, =.md= for Markdown)
3. Run =Scimax: Refresh Journal View=
4. Restart VS Code

** Navigation Shortcuts Not Working

=Alt+[= and =Alt+]= only work when:

- Current file is a journal entry
- Filename matches =YYYY-MM-DD.org= or =YYYY-MM-DD.md=
- File is inside the configured journal directory

** Statistics Not Updating

Statistics are cached for performance:

- Refresh calendar view to force update
- Statistics update automatically after 1 minute
- Saving a journal file triggers update

** Calendar Not Showing Entries

If the calendar appears empty:

1. Check that entries exist in the correct directory structure
2. Run =Scimax: Refresh Journal View=
3. Verify file naming matches =YYYY-MM-DD.org= or =.md=
4. Check for file system permissions issues

* Advanced Usage

** Scripting and Automation

Since journal entries are plain text files in a predictable structure, you can script operations:

*** Auto-generate Weekly Summary

#+begin_src python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import glob

journal_dir = os.path.expanduser("~/scimax-journal")
today = datetime.now()
week_start = today - timedelta(days=today.weekday())

# Collect this week's entries
entries = []
for i in range(7):
    day = week_start + timedelta(days=i)
    path = os.path.join(
        journal_dir,
        f"{day.year}/{day.month:02d}/{day.day:02d}",
        f"{day.year}-{day.month:02d}-{day.day:02d}.org"
    )
    if os.path.exists(path):
        with open(path) as f:
            entries.append((day, f.read()))

# Generate summary
print(f"# Week of {week_start.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}\n")
for day, content in entries:
    print(f"## {day.strftime('%A %Y-%m-%d')}\n")
    # Extract tasks or headings
    tasks = [line for line in content.split('\n') if line.strip().startswith('- [')]
    if tasks:
        print('\n'.join(tasks))
    print()
#+end_src

*** Export to PDF

#+begin_src bash
#!/bin/bash
# Export recent journal entries to PDF

cd ~/scimax-journal

# Find entries from last 30 days
find . -name "*.org" -mtime -30 | while read file; do
    pandoc "$file" -o "${file%.org}.pdf"
done
#+end_src

** Custom Template Variables

Currently, template variables are fixed, but you can post-process entries:

#+begin_src bash
# Add custom metadata after creation
sed -i '3i#+TAGS: daily' ~/scimax-journal/2026/01/14/2026-01-14.org
#+end_src

** Integration with External Tools

*** Obsidian Daily Notes

To use the same directory structure with Obsidian:

1. Set Obsidian's daily notes folder to your journal directory
2. Use the same date format (=YYYY-MM-DD=)
3. Adjust template format as needed

*** Emacs org-journal

The directory structure is compatible with some org-journal configurations:
