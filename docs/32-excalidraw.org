*Keybinding Note:* This extension uses Emacs-style keybindings where Ctrl is used on all platforms (not Cmd on Mac), except where explicitly noted.

* ✅ Overview
CLOSED: [2026-01-18 Sun 08:34]

Scimax VS Code integrates with the [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor][Excalidraw VS Code extension]] to provide
seamless support for creating and editing diagrams directly from org-mode
documents.

** ✅ Prerequisites
CLOSED: [2026-01-18 Sun 08:34]

Install the Excalidraw extension from the VS Code marketplace:

| Extension ID              | Name               |
|---------------------------+--------------------|
| pomdtr.excalidraw-editor  | Excalidraw Editor  |

You can install it via:
- Command Palette: =Extensions: Install Extensions= → search "Excalidraw"
- Or run: =code --install-extension pomdtr.excalidraw-editor=

* ✅ Supported File Formats
CLOSED: [2026-01-18 Sun 08:35]

Excalidraw supports multiple file formats, all of which work with this integration:

| Extension           | Description                              | Hover Preview |
|---------------------+------------------------------------------+---------------|
| .excalidraw         | Native Excalidraw format (JSON)          | Via exports   |
| .excalidraw.json    | Explicit JSON format                     | Via exports   |
| .excalidraw.svg     | SVG with embedded Excalidraw scene data  | Yes           |
| .excalidraw.png     | PNG with embedded Excalidraw scene data  | Yes           |

*Recommendation:* Use =.excalidraw.svg= or =.excalidraw.png= for best experience:
- These formats show hover previews directly
- They embed the full Excalidraw scene data, so they remain fully editable
- They can be displayed in exports (HTML, LaTeX, Markdown)

* Creating Excalidraw Links

Use standard org-mode link syntax to reference Excalidraw drawings:

** Basic Links


[[_static/drawing.excalidraw]]


* ✅ Hover Preview

When you hover over an Excalidraw link, a tooltip appears showing:

1. *Drawing name* - The filename or link description
2. *Visual preview* - For all Excalidraw file types:
   - =.excalidraw.svg= and =.excalidraw.png= files show the image directly
   - =.excalidraw= and =.excalidraw.json= files show a generated SVG preview
3. *Element count* - Number of shapes in the drawing
4. *File information* - Size and last modified date

The hover preview for =.excalidraw= files renders a simplified SVG showing:
- Rectangles, ellipses, and diamonds with their colors
- Lines and arrows with arrowheads
- Freedraw paths
- Text and image placeholders

For best results, the extension first looks for companion export files (same name
with =.svg= or =.png= extension). If none exist, it generates a preview from the
JSON data.

* ✅ Click to Edit
CLOSED: [2026-01-18 Sun 08:36]

Clicking an Excalidraw link opens the drawing in the Excalidraw visual editor.

** ✅ Existing Files
CLOSED: [2026-01-18 Sun 08:36]

When you click a link to an existing Excalidraw file:
1. The file opens in the Excalidraw editor
2. You can edit the drawing visually
3. Changes are saved automatically

** ✅ New Files (Auto-creation)
CLOSED: [2026-01-18 Sun 08:36]

When you click a link to a non-existent Excalidraw file:
1. The file is automatically created with an empty drawing
2. Parent directories are created if needed
3. The new drawing opens in the Excalidraw editor

This makes it easy to create new diagrams - just write the link and click it:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
# This file doesn't exist yet - clicking creates it
[[new-diagram.excalidraw][My New Diagram]]
#+END_SRC

** ✅ Fallback Behavior
CLOSED: [2026-01-18 Sun 08:36]

If the Excalidraw extension is not installed:
1. The file opens as a text document (showing JSON)
2. A message suggests installing the Excalidraw extension

* ✅ Commands
CLOSED: [2026-01-18 Sun 08:39]

| Command                      | Description             | Invocation         |
|------------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------|
| scimax.org.openExcalidraw    | Open Excalidraw Drawing | Click on link      |

The command is automatically invoked when clicking Excalidraw links. It can also
be called programmatically:

#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
vscode.commands.executeCommand('scimax.org.openExcalidraw', {
    file: '/path/to/drawing.excalidraw'
});
#+END_SRC

* ✅ Workflow Tips
CLOSED: [2026-01-18 Sun 08:39]

** 👀 Organizing Drawings

Keep drawings organized alongside your org files:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
project/
├── notes.org
├── diagrams/
│   ├── architecture.excalidraw.svg
│   ├── dataflow.excalidraw.svg
│   └── ui-mockup.excalidraw.png
└── docs/
    └── design.org
#+END_EXAMPLE

** 👀 Export for Sharing

Excalidraw's =.excalidraw.svg= and =.excalidraw.png= formats are ideal because:
- They display correctly in web browsers and image viewers
- They can be embedded in HTML/PDF exports
- They retain full editability (scene data is embedded)

** 👀 Version Control

All Excalidraw formats are text-based (JSON or JSON-embedded), making them
suitable for version control with git. The =.excalidraw.svg= format shows
meaningful diffs for the SVG portions.

* ✅ Troubleshooting
CLOSED: [2026-01-18 Sun 08:40]

** 👀 Drawing won't open in visual editor

- Ensure the Excalidraw extension is installed: =pomdtr.excalidraw-editor=
- Check that the file extension is correct (=.excalidraw=, =.excalidraw.json=,
  =.excalidraw.svg=, or =.excalidraw.png=)
- Try reloading VS Code window

** ✅ No hover preview appears

- All Excalidraw file types now show hover previews
- For =.excalidraw= files, a simplified SVG is generated from the JSON
- The file must exist on disk for preview to work
- Empty drawings show "Empty drawing" instead of a preview

** ✅ Link not recognized as Excalidraw
CLOSED: [2026-01-18 Sun 08:40]

Ensure the file extension is one of:
- =.excalidraw=
- =.excalidraw.json=
- =.excalidraw.svg=
- =.excalidraw.png=
