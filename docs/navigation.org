* ✅ Navigation
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:32]

Scimax VS Code provides powerful navigation features inspired by Emacs, including
fuzzy search, avy-style jumping, and structured outline navigation. These features
work seamlessly across org-mode and markdown documents, making it easy to move
around your files quickly and efficiently.

* ✅ Overview
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:32]

Navigation in Scimax VS Code follows three main paradigms:

1. *Outline Navigation* - Move between structural elements (headings, source blocks)
2. *Fuzzy Search* - Swiper-style incremental search with live preview
3. *Jump Navigation* - Avy-style quick jumps to visible text using character hints
4. *Speed Commands* - Single-key navigation when at heading start

- [[file:keybindings.org][Keybindings]] for a complete reference of keyboard shortcuts

* ✅ Outline Navigation
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:32]

Outline navigation lets you move between structural elements in your document -
headings, source blocks, and other landmarks.

** ✅ Heading Navigation
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:36]

Navigate between headings in org-mode and markdown documents:

| Command                    | Key Binding | Description              |
|----------------------------+-------------+--------------------------|
| scimax.org.nextHeading     | C-c n       | Jump to next heading     |
| scimax.org.previousHeading | C-c p       | Jump to previous heading |
| scimax.org.parentHeading   | -           | Jump to parent heading   |
| scimax.org.jumpToHeading   | C-c C-j     | Fuzzy search headings    |



*** ✅ Next/Previous Heading
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:36]

Move through all headings in document order:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* First Heading
Content here...

,** Subheading A        <- Current position
Content...

,** Subheading B        <- Next heading
More content...

,* Second Heading       <- Another next heading
#+END_SRC

The nextHeading command moves forward through headings regardless of level.
Similarly, previousHeading moves backward.

*** ✅ Parent Heading
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 08:01]

Jump to the parent (containing) heading:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Parent Heading       <- Jump here
,** Child Heading
,*** Current Position   <- From here
#+END_SRC

This is useful for quickly navigating up the document hierarchy.

*** ✅ Jump to Heading
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:38]

The jumpToHeading command (C-c C-j) opens a fuzzy search picker showing all
headings in the current document. Type to filter, and select a heading to jump to it.

Features:
- Live preview - cursor moves as you browse
- Fuzzy matching - type any part of the heading title
- Shows heading hierarchy with indentation
- Displays TODO states and tags

** ✅ Source Block Navigation
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 08:03]

Navigate between source blocks in org documents:

| Command                 | Key Binding | Description               |
|-------------------------+-------------+---------------------------|
| scimax.ob.nextBlock     | C-c n       | Jump to next source block |
| scimax.ob.previousBlock | C-c p       | Jump to previous block    |
| scimax.ob.jumpToBlock   | -           | Fuzzy search blocks       |
| scimax.ob.jumpToResults | -           | Jump to results section   |

There are also speed-commands if you are the beginning of a block to navigate with n (next) and p (previous.)

*** ✅ Next/Previous Source Block
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:40]

Move between source blocks in document order:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
Some text...

,#+BEGIN_SRC python      <- Current position
print("Hello")
,#+END_SRC

More text...

,#+BEGIN_SRC python      <- Next block
print("World")
,#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

These commands skip over regular text and headings, jumping directly to the next
or previous #+BEGIN_SRC block.

*** ⚠️ Jump to Source Block

The jumpToBlock command shows a fuzzy picker of all source blocks in the
document. Each block is labeled with:
- Language (e.g., python, javascript)
- Block name (if it has a #+NAME: line)
- Preview of first line of code

*** ⚠️ Jump to Results

When cursor is in a source block, jumpToResults jumps to the #+RESULTS:
section below the block (if it exists). This is useful after executing a block
to quickly review the output.

** ✅ Sibling Navigation (Speed Commands)
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:41]

Speed commands provide efficient navigation between sibling headings (headings
at the same level):

| Key | Command                      | Description                    |
|-----+------------------------------+--------------------------------|
| f   | scimax.speed.nextSibling     | Next heading at same level     |
| b   | scimax.speed.previousSibling | Previous heading at same level |

These commands only work when:
1. Speed commands are enabled
2. Cursor is at the beginning of a heading line

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Parent
,** Sibling 1
,** Sibling 2          <- Press 'f' to jump to Sibling 3
,** Sibling 3          <- Press 'b' to jump back to Sibling 2
,** Sibling 4
#+END_SRC

Sibling navigation skips over child headings:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,** Sibling 1           <- Current position
,*** Child of Sibling 1
,*** Another child
,** Sibling 2           <- Press 'f' jumps here (skips children)
#+END_SRC

* ✅ Fuzzy Search (Swiper-Style)
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:42]

Fuzzy search provides incremental search with live preview, inspired by Emacs
Swiper. As you type, matching lines are filtered and the cursor moves to show
a live preview.

** ✅ Search Current File
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:42]

| Command            | Key Binding | Description                  |
|--------------------+-------------+------------------------------|
| scimax.fuzzySearch | C-c s       | Search lines in current file |

Opens a quick pick showing all non-empty lines in the current file. Features:

- *Live preview* - cursor moves to selected line as you browse
- *Fuzzy matching* - type space-separated terms, all must match
- *Match highlighting* - matching terms are highlighted in results
- *Cancel restores position* - press Escape to return to original location

Example workflow:
1. Press C-c s to open fuzzy search
2. Type "function calculate" to find lines with both words
3. Use arrow keys or continue typing to narrow results
4. Press Enter to jump to selected line
5. Press Escape to cancel and return to original position

** ⚠️ Search Open Files

| Command                     | Key Binding | Description                    |
|-----------------------------+-------------+--------------------------------|
| scimax.fuzzySearchOpenFiles | C-c Shift-s | Search lines in all open files |

Like fuzzy search but searches across all open buffers/files. Results are
grouped by file with file separators.

Use this to:
- Find text across multiple open files
- Navigate between related files quickly
- Review related code across different modules

** ✅ Search Outline (Headings/Symbols)
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:45]

| Command                   | Key Binding | Description                 |
|---------------------------+-------------+-----------------------------|
| scimax.fuzzySearchOutline | C-c M-s     | Search headings and symbols |

Searches only structural elements:

- *Org files* - Headlines (lines starting with *)
- *Markdown files* - Headings (lines starting with #)
- *Code files* - Function/class definitions

This provides a fast way to navigate document structure without seeing every line.

Icons indicate heading level:
- $(symbol-class) - Top-level or class
- $(symbol-class) $(symbol-class) - Second level
- $(symbol-method) - Functions/methods

* ✅ Jump Navigation (Avy-Style)
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:46]

Jump navigation provides character-based quick jumps to visible text, inspired
by Emacs Avy. You specify what to jump to (character, word, line), and each
match is labeled with a hint character. Type the hint to jump instantly.

** ✅ Jump to Character
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:49]

| Command               | Key Binding | Description                  |
|-----------------------+-------------+------------------------------|
| scimax.jump.gotoChar  | C-c jc      | Jump to any character        |
| scimax.jump.gotoChar2 | C-c jj      | Jump to 2-character sequence |

*** ✅ Single Character
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:49]

1. Invoke scimax.jump.gotoChar
2. Type a character (e.g., "e")
3. All visible occurrences of "e" are labeled: a, s, d, f, etc.
4. Type the label to jump (e.g., type "s" to jump to the second occurrence)

*** ✅ Two Characters
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:49]

For more precision, use scimax.jump.gotoChar2:

1. Invoke the command
2. Type two characters (e.g., "th")
3. All visible "th" sequences are labeled
4. Type the label to jump

This reduces the number of matches, making jumps faster.

** ✅ Jump to Word
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:51]

| Command              | Key Binding | Description         |
|----------------------+-------------+---------------------|
| scimax.jump.gotoWord | C-c jw      | Jump to word starts |

Jumps to word boundaries. You can optionally filter by starting character:

1. Invoke scimax.jump.gotoWord
2. Enter a starting character or leave empty for all words
3. All matching word starts are labeled
4. Type the label to jump

Example: Type "f" to see only words starting with "f" (function, for, first, etc.)

** ✅ Jump to Line
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:51]

| Command              | Key Binding | Description              |
|----------------------+-------------+--------------------------|
| scimax.jump.gotoLine | C-c jl      | Jump to any visible line |

Labels every visible line for quick vertical navigation:

1. Invoke scimax.jump.gotoLine
2. Every visible line gets a label (a, s, d, etc.)
3. Type the label to jump to that line

The cursor is placed at the first non-whitespace character of the selected line.

** ⚠️ Jump to Symbol

| Command                | Key Binding | Description                  |
|------------------------+-------------+------------------------------|
| scimax.jump.gotoSymbol | C-c jo      | Jump to symbols and headings |

Jumps to structural elements in the visible area:

- Function/class definitions
- Org headings (* Heading)
- Markdown headings (# Heading)
- Comment markers (TODO, FIXME, NOTE, etc.)

Only visible symbols are labeled, making it very fast for navigating code structure.

** ✅ Jump to Subword
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:53]

| Command                 | Key Binding | Description                |
|-------------------------+-------------+----------------------------|
| scimax.jump.gotoSubword | C-c jw      | Jump to subword boundaries |

Jumps to camelCase and snake_case boundaries:

- myVariableName - Labels 'm', 'V', 'N'
- my_variable_name - Labels 'm', 'v', 'n'
- MY_CONSTANT - Labels 'M', 'C'

Useful for navigating within identifiers in code.

** ✅ Jump Actions
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:53]

Beyond navigation, jump commands can perform actions:

| Command              | Key Binding | Description                 |
|----------------------+-------------+-----------------------------|
| scimax.jump.copyLine | -           | Select a line and copy it   |
| scimax.jump.killLine | -           | Select a line and delete it |

These commands use the same labeling system but perform actions instead of
just moving the cursor.

** ✅ Label Characters
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:53]

Jump labels use home row keys for efficiency, ordered by ease of typing:

: a s d f j k l g h q w e r u i o p z x c v b n m t y

- Small numbers of matches use single characters
- Larger numbers of matches use two-character combinations (aa, as, ad, etc.)

* ✅ Document Symbol Provider
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:53]

VS Code's built-in outline view and breadcrumb navigation are enhanced with
org-mode support.

** ✅ Outline View
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:54]

The Outline panel (View -> Outline) shows document structure:

For org files:
- Document title (from #+TITLE:)
- All headings in hierarchical structure
- TODO state indicators (box for TODO, check for DONE)
- Tags and priorities shown as details
- Source blocks (labeled with language)
- Tables
- Drawers

Symbols use semantic icons:
- $(symbol-class) - Level 1 headings
- $(symbol-method) - Level 2 headings
- $(symbol-function) - Level 3 headings
- $(symbol-key) - TODO items
- $(symbol-event) - DONE items

** ✅ Breadcrumb Navigation
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:54]

The breadcrumb bar at the top of the editor shows your location in the
document hierarchy:

: Document Title > Level 1 Heading > Level 2 Heading > Current Position

Click any breadcrumb to see siblings and navigate quickly.

** ✅ Quick Outline
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:54]

Press Ctrl+Shift+O (or Cmd+Shift+O on Mac) to open VS Code's quick outline:

- Shows all document symbols
- Type to filter
- Press Enter to jump to symbol

This works similar to fuzzySearchOutline but uses VS Code's native UI.

* ✅ Go to Definition
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:54]

While not Scimax-specific, VS Code's go to definition works in org files for:

- Links ([[file:other.org][Other File]])
- Internal links ([[*Heading Name]])
- Reference citations (requires org-ref extension)

| Command                        | Key Binding | Description         |
|--------------------------------+-------------+---------------------|
| editor.action.revealDefinition | F12         | Go to definition    |
| editor.action.peekDefinition   | Alt+F12     | Peek definition     |
| editor.action.goToReferences   | Shift+F12   | Find all references |

* ✅ Navigation History
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 08:00]

VS Code tracks your navigation history across files:

| Command                          | Key Binding | Description             |
|----------------------------------+-------------+-------------------------|
| workbench.action.navigateBack    | C-x C-Left  | Go to previous location |
| workbench.action.navigateForward | C-x C-Right | Go to next location     |

Every jump creates a history entry:
- Jump to heading
- Follow a link
- Go to definition
- Search result navigation

Use these commands to backtrack through your navigation path.

* ✅ Speed Commands
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:56]

Speed commands provide single-key navigation when the cursor is at the start
of a heading. See the table in [[*Sibling Navigation (Speed Commands)]] above, or
press ? at a heading start to see all speed commands.

Navigation speed commands (available at heading start):

| Key | Command                  | Description                    |
|-----+--------------------------+--------------------------------|
| n   | Next visible heading     | Move to next heading           |
| p   | Previous visible heading | Move to previous heading       |
| f   | Next sibling heading     | Next heading at same level     |
| b   | Previous sibling heading | Previous heading at same level |
| u   | Parent heading           | Jump to parent heading         |
| j   | Jump to heading          | Fuzzy search headings          |
| g   | Go to... submenu         | More navigation options        |

To enable speed commands:
1. Open settings (Ctrl+,)
2. Search for "scimax speed commands"
3. Enable "Scimax: Speed Commands Enabled"

Or add to settings.json:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "scimax.speedCommandsEnabled": true
}
#+END_SRC

* ✅ Tips and Workflows
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:58]

** ✅ Quick Heading Navigation
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:58]

Combine speed commands and fuzzy search:

1. Use j speed command for fuzzy heading search (when at heading start)
2. Use C-c C-j for heading search (from anywhere)
3. Use f/b speed commands to move between siblings
4. Use n/p speed commands to scan all headings

** ✅ Finding Code in Large Files
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:58]

For code files:

1. C-c M-s - Search outline to find function/class
2. scimax.jump.gotoSymbol - Jump to visible function
3. Ctrl+Shift+O - VS Code quick outline for all symbols

** ✅ Cross-File Navigation
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:59]

When working across multiple files:

1. C-c S-s - Search all open files
2. Open related files
3. Use navigation history (Alt+Left/Alt+Right) to move between locations
4. Use breadcrumbs to see context

** ✅ Precision Jumping
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:59]

For maximum precision:

1. scimax.jump.gotoChar2 - Two characters gives fewer matches
2. scimax.jump.gotoSubword - Jump within camelCase names
3. scimax.jump.gotoWord with starting character - Filter words

** ✅ Source Block Workflows
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:59]

When working with literate programming:

1. scimax.ob.jumpToBlock - Find block by name/language
2. scimax.ob.nextBlock/previousBlock - Navigate between blocks
3. scimax.ob.jumpToResults - Check execution results
4. Execute block (C-c C-c)
5. Jump to results to verify output

* ✅ Configuration
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:35]

** ✅ Enable/Disable Features
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:35]

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  // Enable speed commands (single-key navigation at heading start)
  "scimax.speedCommandsEnabled": true,

  // Maximum number of items in fuzzy search (performance)
  "scimax.fuzzySearch.maxResults": 1000
}
#+END_SRC

** ✅ Custom Keybindings
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:35]

Add custom keybindings in keybindings.json:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
[
  // Custom jump to character binding
  {
    "key": "ctrl+;",
    "command": "scimax.jump.gotoChar",
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
  },

  // Custom next source block binding
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+n",
    "command": "scimax.ob.nextBlock",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == 'org'"
  }
]
#+END_SRC

* ✅ Troubleshooting
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:35]

** ✅ Fuzzy Search Not Working
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:34]

If fuzzy search doesn't show results:

1. Check that the file has non-empty lines
2. Try searching with simpler terms
3. Check if file is too large (increase maxResults setting)

** ✅ Speed Commands Not Triggering
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:34]

Speed commands require:

1. scimax.speedCommandsEnabled set to true
2. Cursor at column 0 (start of line)
3. Cursor on a heading line (starts with * in org, # in markdown)

Move cursor to beginning of heading with Home key, then try speed command.

** ✅ Jump Labels Not Appearing
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:34]

If jump commands don't show labels:

1. Make sure there are visible matches in the viewport
2. Check that the editor has focus
3. Try scrolling to ensure matches are visible

** ✅ Navigation History Not Working
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:34]

VS Code's navigation history works best when:

1. You make explicit jumps (jump commands, follow links)
2. You move between files
3. You use go to definition

Cursor movement with arrow keys doesn't create history entries.

* ✅ Comparison with Emacs
CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 07:34]

Scimax VS Code navigation is inspired by Emacs packages:

| Emacs Package  | VS Code Equivalent       | Notes                           |
|----------------+--------------------------+---------------------------------|
| Avy            | scimax.jump.* commands   | Character-based jumping         |
| Swiper         | scimax.fuzzySearch       | Incremental search with preview |
| Helm/Ivy       | Quick Pick UI            | VS Code native fuzzy picker     |
| Org speed keys | Speed commands           | Single-key commands at heading  |
| Imenu          | Document symbol provider | Outline view and breadcrumbs    |

Key differences:

- VS Code uses Quick Pick UI instead of minibuffer
- Some Emacs packages have richer configuration
- VS Code navigation history is cross-file by default
- Speed commands in VS Code require explicit enable
