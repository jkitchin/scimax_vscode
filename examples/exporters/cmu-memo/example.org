* Summary

This memo proposes changes to the Master of Science degree requirements in the Department of Chemical Engineering. The proposed changes aim to modernize the curriculum and better prepare students for careers in data-driven chemical engineering.

* Proposed Changes

** New Course Requirements

1. Add "Machine Learning for Chemical Engineers" as a required course
2. Replace one elective with a computational methods requirement
3. Allow credit for approved online courses from partner institutions

** Timeline

The proposed changes would take effect starting Fall 2025 semester.

* Justification

The chemical engineering industry increasingly requires graduates with strong computational and data science skills. These changes align with:

- Industry feedback from our corporate advisory board
- Student surveys indicating demand for more computational training
- National trends in chemical engineering education

* Requested Action

We request the committee review and approve these curriculum changes at the next scheduled meeting.
