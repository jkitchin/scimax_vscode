#+TITLE: Machine Learning Methods for Catalyst Design
#+AUTHOR: Jane Smith
#+DATE: May 2024
#+ABSTRACT: This thesis presents novel machine learning methods for accelerating the discovery of heterogeneous catalysts. We develop a graph neural network approach that can predict adsorption energies with chemical accuracy (MAE < 0.1 eV) while being 10^6 times faster than density functional theory calculations. The model is applied to screen over 100,000 candidate materials for the oxygen reduction reaction, identifying 15 promising candidates that were subsequently validated experimentally. Our results demonstrate that machine learning can significantly accelerate the catalyst discovery pipeline.

* Introduction

The discovery of new catalysts is critical for sustainable energy and chemical production. Traditional catalyst development relies on trial-and-error experimentation, which is slow and expensive. Computational methods based on density functional theory (DFT) have accelerated this process, but remain computationally demanding.

Machine learning offers a path to even faster catalyst screening by learning patterns from existing DFT data and generalizing to new materials. This thesis develops and applies machine learning methods for catalyst discovery.

** Research Objectives

The main objectives of this thesis are:

1. Develop accurate machine learning models for predicting catalytic properties
