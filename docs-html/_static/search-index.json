This chapter covers how to create and work with document structure in Scimax VS Code. ✅ Headlines CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:25] Headlines are the backbone of org documents. They define the structure and allow for powerful outline-based navigation and organization. ✅ Creating Headlines CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:25] A headline starts with one or more asterisks (*) at the beginning of a line, followed by a space: ,* Top Level Headline ,** Second Level ,*** Third Level ,**** Fourth Level There is no hard limit on headline levels, but most documents use 3-5 levels. ✅ Headline Components CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:25] A headline can contain several components: ,* TODO [#A] Headline Title :tag1:tag2: Component Description Example Stars Define the level (required) *, **, *** TODO keyword Task state (optional) TODO, DONE Priority Importance marker (optional) [#A], [#B] Title The headline text (required) Any text Tags Categorization labels (optional) :work:urgent: ✅ Headline Levels CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:26] Headlines can be nested to any depth: ,* Level 1: Main Section ,** Level 2: Subsection ,*** Level 3: Sub-subsection ,**** Level 4: Paragraph grouping ,***** Level 5: Fine detail Use consistent levels throughout your document. Skipping levels (e.g., going from * to ***) works but may cause confusion. ✅ Visibility Cycling CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:26] One of the most powerful features of org documents is the ability to fold (collapse) and unfold (expand) sections to manage complexity. ✅ Folding with Tab CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:26] Press Tab on a headline to cycle through visibility states: State Shows Folded Only the headline, children hidden Children Headline and immediate child headlines Subtree All content under this headline Example cycle: * Heading... (folded - ellipsis shows hidden content) * Heading with child headlines visible * Heading with all content visible ✅ Global Cycling with Shift-Tab CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:26] Press S-<tab> anywhere in the document to cycle global visibility: State Shows Overview Only top-level headlines Contents All headlines at all levels Show All Everything expanded ✅ Visibility Commands CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:26] Key Command <tab> Cycle visibility at current heading S-<tab> Cycle global visibility Additional visibility can be controlled through speed commands (see Speed Commands ): Speed Key Action c Cycle visibility C Show children o Overview (fold all) ✅ Motion Between Headlines CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:27] Efficient navigation between headlines is essential for working with large documents. ✅ Navigation Commands CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:27] Key Command C-c C-j Jump to any heading (with menu) Next/Previous heading Built-in VS Code outline ✅ Using the Outline View CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:27] The VS Code Outline view provides visual navigation: Open the Outline view (sidebar or Cmd/C-S-O) Click any heading to jump to it Use the filter box to search headings ✅ Jump to Heading CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:27] Press C-c C-j to open a quick-pick menu of all headings. Type to filter and press Enter to jump. ✅ Speed Command Navigation CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:27] With speed commands enabled (scimax.speedCommands.enabled: true), when your cursor is at the beginning of a headline, single keys navigate: Key Action n Next heading (any level) p Previous heading (any level) f Next heading (same level - forward) b Previous heading (same level - back) u Up to parent heading j Jump to heading (opens menu) g Go to... (opens navigation menu) ✅ Structure Editing CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:28] Scimax VS Code provides commands to restructure your document without manual cut-and-paste. ✅ Promote/Demote Headlines CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:28] Change the level of a headline: Key Command M-<left> Promote heading (decrease level) M-<right> Demote heading (increase level) M-S-Left Promote subtree M-S-Right Demote subtree ✅ Single Heading vs Subtree CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:28] Promote/Demote Heading : Changes only the current headline's level Promote/Demote Subtree : Changes the headline AND all its children Example - promoting a subtree: ,** Parent * Parent ,*** Child 1 -> ** Child 1 ,*** Child 2 ** Child 2 ⚠️ Move Subtrees Up/Down Reorder sections without changing their level: Key Command M-<up> Move subtree up (swap with previous) M-<down> Move subtree down (swap with next) The entire subtree (heading and all its content/children) moves together. ✅ Kill/Clone Subtrees CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:31] Command Description scimax.org.killSubtree Cut the current subtree scimax.org.cloneSubtree Duplicate the current subtree Speed command keys (at heading start): Key Action w Kill (cut) subtree W Clone (duplicate) subtree y Yank (paste) subtree ✅ Insert New Headings CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:31] Key Command C-<return> Insert heading at same level The command scimax.org.insertHeading inserts a new heading. The behavior depends on context: On a heading line: Insert new heading at same level In body text: Insert new heading after current section For subheadings: Command Description scimax.org.insertSubheading Insert heading one level deeper ✅ Document Keywords CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:32] Document keywords appear at the beginning of the file and configure document-wide settings. ✅ Common Keywords CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:32] ,#+TITLE: Document Title ,#+AUTHOR: Author Name ,#+DATE: 2026-01-13 ,#+EMAIL: author@example.com ✅ Options Keyword CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:32] The #+OPTIONS: keyword controls export and display behavior: ,#+OPTIONS: toc:2 num:t H:4 ^:nil Option Values Description toc t, nil, number Table of contents depth num t, nil Section numbering H number Headline levels for export ^ t, nil, {} Subscript/superscript handling author t, nil Include author in export date t, nil Include date in export ⚠️ Startup Keyword Control initial visibility: ,#+STARTUP: overview # Start with all headings folded ,#+STARTUP: content # Show all headings, hide body ,#+STARTUP: showall # Show everything ⚠️ Property Keyword Set default properties for source blocks: ,#+PROPERTY: header-args :exports both ,#+PROPERTY: header-args:python :session *python* ✅ Properties Drawers CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:32] Properties drawers store metadata about a headline in key-value pairs. ✅ Creating Properties Drawers CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:32] Properties appear in a :PROPERTIES: drawer immediately after the headline: ,* My Headline :PROPERTIES: :CUSTOM_ID: my-headline :CATEGORY: work :EFFORT: 2:00 :END: ✅ Special Properties CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:33] Certain properties have special meaning: Property Description ID Globally unique identifier (UUID) CUSTOM_ID Document-unique identifier for linking CATEGORY Category for agenda views EFFORT Estimated time (H:MM format) COLUMNS Column view format specification VISIBILITY Initial visibility (folded, children, all) ✅ Adding Properties CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:33] To add a property via speed commands, press P at a heading start. You can also add properties manually by typing inside the drawer. ⚠️ Inherited Properties Some properties are inherited by child headlines. The CATEGORY property, for example, applies to all children unless overridden. ⚠️ Drawers Drawers are collapsible sections that hide auxiliary information. ⚠️ Standard Drawers ⚠️ PROPERTIES Drawer Stores headline metadata (see above). ⚠️ LOGBOOK Drawer Stores clock entries and state change history: ,* TODO My Task :LOGBOOK: CLOCK: [2026-01-13 Mon 09:00]--[2026-01-13 Mon 10:30] => 1:30 - State \"TODO\" from \"WAITING\" [2026-01-12 Sun 14:00] :END: ⚠️ Custom Drawers Create custom drawers for any purpose: ,* Research Notes :NOTES: These are private notes that won't be exported. - Reference: Smith et al. 2024 - Follow up with collaborator :END: :REFERENCES: - [[cite:smith-2024]] - [[cite:jones-2023]] :END: Drawer names must be uppercase letters and can contain numbers and underscores. ⚠️ Drawer Visibility Drawers are typically displayed collapsed. Click or use fold commands to expand/collapse them. ✅ Inline Tasks CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:34] Inline tasks are special headlines at a very deep level (default: 15 stars or more) that are treated as inline content within a section rather than as document structure. ✅ Creating Inline Tasks CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:34] An inline task uses many stars (15+) and has a matching END marker: ,* Main Headline Content of the headline. ,*************** TODO Quick inline task This is an inline task that doesn't affect document structure. It's useful for small, self-contained TODOs within prose. ,*************** END More content continues here. ✅ Inline Task Features CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:34] Inline tasks support the same features as regular headlines: Feature Example TODO state *************** TODO Task Priority *************** [#A] High priority Tags *************** Task :urgent:work: Body text Content between task and END ✅ When to Use Inline Tasks CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:35] Quick TODOs embedded in documentation Small tasks that don't warrant their own section Notes or reminders within prose Tasks that shouldn't appear in document outline ✅ Configuration CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:35] The minimum headline level for inline tasks is configurable. By default, headlines with 15 or more stars are treated as inline tasks. ✅ Footnote Definitions CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:35] Footnotes allow you to add supplementary information without interrupting the main text flow. ✅ Footnote Definition Syntax CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:35] Footnotes are defined with [fn:LABEL] at the start of a line: This paragraph has a footnote reference[fn:1].

This feature, borrowed from Emacs org-mode, provides lightning-fast navigation and editing without the need for complex key chords. ✅ What are Speed Commands? CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:44] Speed commands transform the beginning of each heading into a powerful command interface. When your cursor is at column 0 of a heading (the first star * in org-mode or the first hash # in markdown), you can press a single key to execute common operations: Navigation: jump between headings, siblings, parent Visibility: fold/unfold sections Structure editing: move, promote, demote, cut, paste TODO management: cycle states, set priorities Planning: add schedules and deadlines Metadata: set tags, properties, effort estimates Time tracking: clock in and out Archiving: archive completed tasks This approach is significantly faster than using traditional keybindings or menu commands for frequent operations. ✅ Why Use Speed Commands? CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:44] Efficiency : Single keystrokes instead of multi-key combinations Contextual : Only active at heading starts, so no conflicts with normal typing Discoverable : Press ? at a heading start to see all available commands Emacs-compatible : Familiar workflow for Emacs org-mode users ✅ Configuration CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:44] ✅ Enabling Speed Commands CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:44] Speed commands are enabled by default in Scimax VS Code.

Unlike browsing individual files, the Agenda aggregates information across all your documents. ✅ Key Concepts CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 13:34] ✅ Agenda Items CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 13:34] An agenda item is any headline with: A TODO keyword (TODO, DONE, NEXT, WAITING, etc.) A SCHEDULED timestamp A DEADLINE timestamp An active timestamp ✅ Scheduled Items CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 13:34] Tasks with SCHEDULED timestamps appear in the agenda on their scheduled date: * TODO Write report SCHEDULED: <2026-01-15 Wed> This appears in the agenda starting January 15. ✅ Deadlines CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 13:35] Tasks with DEADLINE timestamps appear with warning indicators: * TODO Submit proposal DEADLINE: <2026-01-20 Mon> Shows in the agenda with countdown (e.g., \"in 7 days\") and becomes overdue if not completed. ✅ Overdue Items CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 13:35] Items past their deadline appear prominently with warning indicators and show how many days overdue they are. ✅ Unscheduled TODOs CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 13:35] TODO items without dates can be included in agenda views to ensure nothing is forgotten. ✅ Two Agenda Systems CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 13:35] Scimax VS Code provides two complementary agenda implementations: ✅ Native/File-Based Agenda CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 13:35] Scans org files on-demand Works immediately without indexing Provides tree view in sidebar Commands: scimax.agenda.* Best for: Quick views, smaller document sets ✅ Database-Backed Agenda CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 13:35] Uses indexed data for fast queries Requires indexing files first Integrates with search and filtering Commands: scimax.db.agenda, scimax.db.deadlines Best for: Large document collections, complex queries Both systems can be used together - choose based on your needs. ✅ Agenda View Modes CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 13:35] The agenda can display information in different time-based views. ✅ Day Agenda CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 13:51] Shows items for a single day.

Inspired by Emacs org-capture, it allows you to define templates that automatically format and file your captured content to the right location. What is Capture? Capture is a fast note-taking system that: Collects information quickly with minimal keystrokes Uses templates to structure your notes consistently Automatically files content to the appropriate location Supports various capture types (TODOs, notes, journal entries, code snippets, etc.) Includes context from where you initiated the capture (links, selection, clipboard) Key Features Template-based capture : Define reusable templates for different types of content Flexible targeting : Capture to end of file, under specific headlines, or in date trees Context awareness : Automatically includes links to source location, timestamps, and selected text Quick capture commands : Fast shortcuts for common captures (TODO, note) Preview before saving : Optional preview of captured content before filing Custom variables : Rich template language with placeholders, timestamps, and prompts Philosophy The capture system follows the principle of \"capture first, organize later.\" Instead of interrupting your flow to decide where something belongs or how to format it, you simply invoke a capture template and let the system handle the details. This reduces friction and helps you maintain focus on your primary task. Getting Started Your First Capture The quickest way to capture a TODO is: Press C-c c (or run Scimax: Capture ) Select the \"Todo\" template (or press `t') Enter your task description Press Enter Your TODO is now filed to `todo.org' without leaving your current context. Quick TODO Capture For even faster TODO capture, use the dedicated quick capture command: Press C-c t (or run Scimax: Quick Capture TODO ) Type your task Press Enter This bypasses the template picker and goes straight to TODO capture. Capturing with Context When you invoke capture with text selected: Select some text in your editor Press `C-c c' Choose a template (e.g., \"Code Snippet\") The selected text is automatically included in your capture The capture system also includes a link back to where you initiated the capture, making it easy to return to context later. Capture Templates Built-in Templates Scimax comes with several built-in templates: Todo Template (`t') Captures a TODO item to todo.org : ,* TODO Task description Note Template (`n') Captures a quick note to notes.org : ,* Note title [2026-01-13 Mon 14:30] Note content here... Journal Template (`j') Captures a journal entry to journal.org in a date tree: ,* 2026 ,** 2026-01 January ,*** 2026-01-13 Monday ,**** [2026-01-13 Mon 14:30] Entry title Entry content... Meeting Template (`m') Captures structured meeting notes to meetings.org : ,* Meeting: Subject <2026-01-13 Mon 14:00> ,** Attendees Names... ,** Agenda ,** Notes ,** Action Items Code Snippet Template (`s') Captures code snippets to snippets.org : ,* Description :PROPERTIES: :CREATED: [2026-01-13 Mon 14:30] :SOURCE: [[file:/path/to/source.ts::42]] :END: ,#+BEGIN_SRC python selected code here ,#+END_SRC Bookmark Template (`b') Saves bookmarks to bookmarks.org : ,* [[https://example.com][Page Title]] [2026-01-13 Mon 14:30] Optional notes about the bookmark... Viewing All Templates To see all available templates: Run Scimax: List Capture Templates Or press `C-c c' to see the template picker Each template shows: Its key (single letter shortcut) Template name and description Target file Creating Custom Templates Using the Template Creator The easiest way to create a template is with the interactive creator: Run Scimax: Create Capture Template Enter a key (e.g., `r' for \"Research note\") Enter a name (e.g., \"Research Note\") Specify the target file (e.g., `research.org') Choose where to insert (end of file, under headline, date tree) Enter the template content The template is saved to your VS Code settings and immediately available. Manual Template Configuration You can also define templates directly in settings.json : { \"scimax.capture.templates\": [ { \"key\": \"r\", \"name\": \"Research Note\", \"description\": \"Capture research findings\", \"file\": \"research.org\", \"template\": \"* %^{Topic}\\n%U\\n\\n%?\", \"target\": { \"type\": \"file+headline\", \"headline\": \"Research Notes\" } } ] } Template Structure Each template has these properties: Property Type Required Description key string Yes Single character or short key name string Yes Display name description string No Longer description file string Yes Target file path template string Yes Template content with placeholders target object No Where to insert content (see below) properties object No Properties to add to entry tags array No Tags to add to entry Template Syntax Templates use a powerful placeholder system to insert dynamic content. Basic Placeholders Placeholder Description Example %? Final cursor position * TODO Task%? %i Initial content (selection or clipboard) Description: %i %t Date (inactive timestamp) [2026-01-13 Mon] %T Date and time (active timestamp) <2026-01-13 Mon 14:30> %u Date (inactive timestamp) [2026-01-13 Mon] %U Date and time (inactive timestamp) [2026-01-13 Mon 14:30] %n User name john %f Source file name source.ts %F Source file full path /path/to/source.ts %% Literal percent sign % Interactive Prompts Placeholder Description Example %^{prompt} Prompt for input %^{Task description} %^{prompt\\vert{}default} Prompt with default value %^{Priority\\vert{}HIGH} %^t Prompt for date Asks for date input %^T Prompt for date and time Asks for date/time input %^g Prompt for tags Prompts for comma-separated tags Link Placeholders Placeholder Description Result %a Annotation (link to source) [[file:/path/to/source.ts::42]] %A Annotation with description [[file:/path/to/source.ts::42][source.ts:42]] %l Literal link file:/path/to/source.ts::42 Expression Placeholders Placeholder Description Example %(format-time-string \"%Y-%m\") Custom date format 2026-01 %(current-time) ISO timestamp 2026-01-13T14:30:00.000Z Examples Simple TODO with prompt ,* TODO %^{Task} When captured, prompts for \"Task\" and creates: ,* TODO Write documentation Note with timestamp and link back to source ,* %^{Title} %U %i Source: %a Creates: ,* Meeting notes [2026-01-13 Mon 14:30] Discussed project timeline Source: [[file:/home/user/project.org::25]] Meeting template with multiple prompts ,* %^{Meeting subject} %T ,** Attendees %^{Attendees} ,** Agenda %? Prompts for subject and attendees, places cursor under Agenda. Capture Targets Capture targets determine where your captured content is inserted. File Target (`file') Appends to the end of the file. { \"target\": { \"type\": \"file\" } } With prepend: true , inserts at the beginning (after file-level keywords): { \"target\": { \"type\": \"file\", \"prepend\": true } } Headline Target ( file+headline ) Inserts under a specific headline. If the headline doesn't exist, it's created. { \"target\": { \"type\": \"file+headline\", \"headline\": \"Inbox\" } } This finds or creates a headline * Inbox and appends content as a child. With prepend: true , inserts right after the headline: { \"target\": { \"type\": \"file+headline\", \"headline\": \"Inbox\", \"prepend\": true } } Date Tree Target ( file+datetree ) Creates a hierarchical date tree structure: ,* 2026 ,** 2026-01 January ,*** 2026-01-13 Monday ,**** Your captured content here { \"target\": { \"type\": \"file+datetree\" } } Perfect for journal entries and time-based organization. Default Target If no target is specified, content is appended to the end of the file: { \"file\": \"notes.org\", \"template\": \"* %^{Note}\\n%?\" } Running Capture Capture Command The main capture command opens the template picker: Command : Scimax: Capture Keybinding : C-c c This shows all available templates. Select one to begin capture. Capture by Key If you know the template key, you can capture directly: Command : Scimax: Capture by Key Enter the template key (e.g., `t' for TODO) Quick Capture Commands For common captures, use dedicated quick capture commands: Quick TODO Command : Scimax: Quick Capture TODO Keybinding : C-c t Directly captures a TODO without showing the template picker. Quick Note Command : Scimax: Quick Capture Note Directly captures a note. Capture Process Invoke capture : Press C-c c or run a quick capture command Select template : Choose from the picker (or skip if using quick capture) Fill prompts : Enter values for any %^{prompt} placeholders Preview (optional): Review the captured content Confirm : Press \"Capture\" to file the content The captured content is inserted at the target location, and you receive a confirmation message. Advanced Capture Features Capturing with Selection When you have text selected: Select text in the editor Press `C-c c' Choose a template The selected text is available as %i in your template. Perfect for: Capturing code snippets Quoting text Collecting research excerpts Capturing with Context Links Templates can include links back to where you initiated the capture: `%a' creates a link to the source location %A creates a link with description (filename:line) `%l' creates a literal link string Example template: ,* %^{Note} %U %i Source: %A Creates: ,* Important finding [2026-01-13 Mon 14:30] Selected text here Source: [[file:/home/user/research.org::42][research.org:42]] Capture Preview Enable preview to review content before filing: { \"scimax.capture.showPreview\": true } When enabled, you can: See the expanded template content Review formatting and placement Cancel or confirm the capture Auto-open After Capture Configure whether to open the target file after capture: { \"scimax.capture.openAfterCapture\": true } When enabled, the target file opens and the cursor jumps to the captured content.

source code blocks using Jupyter's powerful kernel infrastructure. This enables interactive computing with support for multiple programming languages, rich output (plots, images, HTML), and persistent sessions with state management. This guide covers everything you need to know about using Jupyter kernels in Scimax VS Code org-mode documents. ⚠️ Overview ⚠️ What is Jupyter? Jupyter is an open-source project that provides interactive computing environments across dozens of programming languages. At its core, Jupyter uses \"kernels\" - language-specific execution engines that run code and return results. ⚠️ What Jupyter Integration Provides The Jupyter integration in Scimax VS Code brings the following capabilities: Multi-language support - Execute Python, Julia, R, and 20+ other languages Interactive sessions - Maintain kernel state across multiple code blocks Rich output - Display plots, images, HTML, LaTeX, and other media types Automatic image saving - Graphics automatically saved to .ob-jupyter/ directory ZeroMQ protocol - Native communication with Jupyter kernels via ZeroMQ Session management - Run multiple kernels simultaneously with named sessions Kernel lifecycle control - Start, stop, restart, and interrupt kernels VS Code integration - Kernel status in status bar, output channel logging ⚠️ Jupyter vs Native Executors Scimax provides two ways to execute code blocks: Native executors - Direct execution via system commands (python, node, etc.) Jupyter executors - Execution via Jupyter kernels (jupyter-python, etc.) ⚠️ When to Use Jupyter Use Jupyter kernels when you need: Persistent sessions with shared state across blocks Rich output like plots, images, or interactive visualizations Kernel-specific features (IPython magics, R plots, Julia macros) Code completion and introspection Multiple parallel sessions ⚠️ When to Use Native Executors Use native executors when you need: Quick one-off script execution Minimal dependencies Shell integration (pipes, redirects) System-level operations ⚠️ Installation and Setup ⚠️ Prerequisites Before using Jupyter kernels, you need: Jupyter installed on your system ZeroMQ native module (automatically included with Scimax) Kernel specifications for your languages of interest ⚠️ Installing Jupyter ⚠️ Python Users If you have Python installed, install Jupyter using pip: # Install Jupyter and IPython kernel pip install jupyter ipykernel # Or using conda conda install jupyter ⚠️ System Package Managers On Linux systems, Jupyter may be available via package managers: # Ubuntu/Debian sudo apt install jupyter jupyter-core python3-ipykernel # Fedora sudo dnf install jupyter-core python3-ipykernel # Arch Linux sudo pacman -S jupyter jupyter-core python-ipykernel ⚠️ macOS with Homebrew brew install jupyter ⚠️ Installing Kernels ⚠️ Python (IPython Kernel) The IPython kernel is installed automatically with Jupyter: pip install ipykernel ⚠️ Julia Install the IJulia kernel from Julia: using Pkg Pkg.add(\"IJulia\") ⚠️ R Install the IRkernel from R: install.packages('IRkernel') IRkernel::installspec() ⚠️ Other Languages Jupyter supports many languages through community kernels: Language Kernel Name Installation JavaScript ijavascript npm install -g ijavascript && ijsinstall TypeScript tslab npm install -g tslab && tslab install Ruby iruby gem install iruby && iruby register Rust evcxr cargo install evcxr_jupyter && evcxr_jupyter --install Go gophernotes go install github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes@latest C++ xeus-cling conda install -c conda-forge xeus-cling Java IJava Download from https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava Scala almond Follow instructions at https://almond.sh Haskell IHaskell stack install ihaskell && ihaskell install ⚠️ Verifying Installation Check which kernels are installed: jupyter kernelspec list This will display all available kernels with their installation paths. ⚠️ Troubleshooting ZeroMQ If you encounter ZeroMQ-related errors, the native module may need rebuilding for VS Code's Electron version. Scimax will display instructions if this is required. The error message will look like: Failed to load ZeroMQ native module. This usually means the module was compiled for a different Node.js version. Follow the on-screen instructions or consult the extension documentation. ⚠️ Using Jupyter Kernels ⚠️ Basic Execution ⚠️ Explicit Jupyter Syntax To explicitly use a Jupyter kernel, prefix the language name with jupyter-: #+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python import numpy as np print(np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).mean()) 3.0 The jupyter- prefix forces Babel to use the Jupyter executor for that language. ⚠️ Supported Languages The Jupyter executor recognizes these language prefixes: Org Language Kernel Language Common Kernel Names jupyter-python python python3, python jupyter-julia julia julia-1.9, julia jupyter-r r ir jupyter-ruby ruby ruby jupyter-rust rust rust, evcxr jupyter-go go gophernotes jupyter-c++ c++ xcpp, xeus-cling jupyter-java java java, ijava jupyter-scala scala scala, almond jupyter-haskell haskell haskell, ihaskell jupyter-javascript javascript javascript, nodejs jupyter-typescript typescript typescript, tslab ⚠️ Session Management ⚠️ Named Sessions Use the :session header argument to maintain persistent kernel state: #+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session my-analysis import pandas as pd data = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [4, 5, 6]}) print(\"Data loaded\") Data loaded # The 'data' variable is still available from the previous block print(data.describe()) x y count 3.000000 3.000000 mean 2.000000 5.000000 std 1.000000 1.000000 min 1.000000 4.000000 25% 1.500000 4.500000 50% 2.000000 5.000000 75% 2.500000 5.500000 max 3.000000 6.000000 All blocks with the same :session name share the same kernel and namespace. ⚠️ Default Session If no session name is specified, blocks use a language-specific default session: #+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session # Uses the default \"python-default\" session x = 42 # Same session, x is still available print(x) ⚠️ Multiple Sessions You can run multiple independent sessions simultaneously: # Session 1: Training model #+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session training import time print(\"Training model...\") time.sleep(5) # Simulate training model = \"trained_model\" import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv('data.csv') print(f\"Loaded {len(data)} rows\") Each session runs in its own kernel with isolated state. ⚠️ Rich Output and Visualization ⚠️ Image Output Jupyter kernels can produce rich output including images. When a code block generates an image (matplotlib plot, Julia plot, etc.), it is automatically saved to the .ob-jupyter/ directory in your document's folder. ⚠️ Python Matplotlib Example #+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session :results file import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100) plt.plot(x, np.sin(x), label='sin(x)') plt.plot(x, np.cos(x), label='cos(x)') plt.xlabel('x') plt.ylabel('y') plt.title('Trigonometric Functions') plt.legend() plt.grid(True) plt.show() The image is automatically linked in the results, and you'll see it rendered in VS Code's org-mode preview. ⚠️ Julia Plots Example #+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-julia :session :results file using Plots x = 0:0.1:2π plot(x, [sin.(x) cos.(x)], label=[\"sin\" \"cos\"], xlabel=\"x\", ylabel=\"y\", title=\"Trigonometric Functions\") ⚠️ R Graphics Example #+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-r :session :results file x <- seq(0, 2*pi, length.out=100) plot(x, sin(x), type='l', col='blue', ylab='y', main='Sine Wave') lines(x, cos(x), col='red') legend('topright', c('sin(x)', 'cos(x)'), col=c('blue', 'red'), lty=1) ⚠️ Supported Output Types The Jupyter integration automatically handles these MIME types: image/png - PNG images (most common for plots) image/svg+xml - SVG vector graphics image/jpeg - JPEG images application/pdf - PDF documents text/html - HTML content (saved as .html for complex output) text/plain - Plain text output text/latex - LaTeX equations ⚠️ The .ob-jupyter Directory All Jupyter output files are saved to .ob-jupyter/ in your document's directory: my-analysis.org .ob-jupyter/ ├── output-1705171200000-0.png ├── output-1705171200001-0.svg └── output-1705171200002-0.html Files are named output-<timestamp>-<counter>.<ext> to ensure uniqueness. generated outputs to version control. ⚠️ Header Arguments Jupyter blocks support all standard Babel header arguments plus Jupyter-specific options. ⚠️ Common Header Arguments ⚠️ :session Controls which kernel session to use: #+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session mysession # Code runs in the \"mysession\" kernel # Code runs in default session # Code runs in a new temporary kernel (no session persistence) ⚠️ :results Controls how results are collected and displayed: # Collect printed output #+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :results output print(\"Hello\") print(\"World\") 2 + 2 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 9]) plt.show() x = expensive_computation() ⚠️ :exports Controls what gets exported to HTML/PDF/LaTeX: # Export both code and results #+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :exports both print(\"This will show code AND output in exports\") print(\"This will show ONLY output in exports\") print(\"This will show ONLY code in exports\") import matplotlib matplotlib.use('Agg') # Backend setup not shown ⚠️ :dir Set the working directory for code execution: #+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :dir /path/to/project import os print(os.getcwd()) # Prints: /path/to/project ⚠️ :var Pass variables between blocks: #+BEGIN_SRC shell :results output echo \"Alice 30\" echo \"Bob 25\" echo \"Carol 35\" Alice 30 Bob 25 Carol 35 # The shell output is passed as a string lines = data.strip().split('\\n') for line in lines: name, age = line.split() print(f\"{name} is {age} years old\") Alice is 30 years old Bob is 25 years old Carol is 35 years old ⚠️ :file Explicitly specify output file path (overrides auto-naming): #+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :file my-plot.png import...","headings":"⚠️ Jupyter Integration ⚠️ Overview ⚠️ What is Jupyter?

This is ideal for creating documentation sites, blogs, or project pages hosted on GitHub Pages. The publishing system follows a wizard-first approach - most users can get started with a few clicks, while power users can customize everything through a JSON configuration file. Quick Start Step 1: Initialize a Publishing Project Run the command Scimax: Initialize Publishing Project ( C-c C-e p i ) to start the 5-step wizard: Project name - A short identifier (e.g., \"my-website\") Source directory - Where your org files are located (default: ./org ) Output directory - Where HTML files will be published (default: ./docs for GitHub Pages) Publishing target - GitHub Pages (recommended) or Local/Custom Sitemap generation - Whether to auto-generate an index page Step 2: Add Content Create or edit `.org' files in your source directory. Each file becomes an HTML page.

This feature brings publication-quality mathematics directly into your editing workflow without requiring manual compilation or external viewers. What is LaTeX Preview? LaTeX preview is a system that automatically compiles and renders LaTeX mathematical expressions as images when you hover over them in your org-mode documents. This provides instant visual feedback for complex equations, matrices, and mathematical notation. Key Features Hover Preview : Rendered equations appear in tooltips when hovering over LaTeX code Multiple Syntax Styles : Support for both dollar-sign and backslash delimiters Dark Mode Aware : Automatically adjusts rendering for light and dark themes Smart Caching : Previously rendered equations are cached for instant display Document Settings : Use custom LaTeX packages and preambles Equation Numbering : Automatic numbering for equation environments Live PDF Preview : Full document preview with bidirectional sync Math Syntax Inline Math Inline math appears within text paragraphs and uses the following delimiters: Dollar Sign Delimiter: $...$ The most common inline math syntax. Text between single dollar signs is rendered as mathematics. The quadratic formula is $x \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ for equation $ax^2 + bx + c 0$. Backslash-Parenthesis Delimiter: \\(...\\) Alternative inline math syntax, preferred in some LaTeX style guides. Einstein's mass-energy equivalence is \\(E = mc^2\\), where \\(c\\) is the speed of light. Currency Detection The preview system intelligently avoids treating dollar amounts as math. Currency patterns like `$100' or `$5.99' are ignored. Display Math Display math appears on its own line, centered and larger than inline math. Double Dollar Signs: $$...$$ Creates unnumbered display equations. $$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \\sqrt{\\pi}$$ ∫₋∞^∞ e^(-x²) dx = √π Backslash Brackets: \\[...\\] Alternative display math syntax, equivalent to `$$...$$'. \\[ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} \\] ∑(n 1 to ∞) 1/n² π²/6 Math Environments LaTeX environments provide advanced layout and automatic numbering. Equation Environment Single numbered equations with automatic numbering. \\begin{equation} E = mc^2 \\end{equation} E = mc² (1) Equation* Environment (Unnumbered) Same as `equation' but without numbering. \\begin{equation*} F = ma \\end{equation*} Align Environment Multi-line equations with alignment points (`&'). \\begin{align} x + y &= 5 \\\\ 2x - y &= 1 \\end{align} x + y = 5 (2) 2x - y = 1 (3) Each line receives its own equation number. Align* Environment (Unnumbered) Multi-line alignment without equation numbers. \\begin{align*} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} &= -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} \\\\ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} &= \\mathbf{J} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t} \\end{align*} Other Numbered Environments All these environments support automatic equation numbering: `gather' - Multiple centered equations `multline' - Single equation split across lines `eqnarray' - Legacy alignment (prefer `align') `alignat' - Alignment with explicit spacing `flalign' - Full-width alignment Add an asterisk ( * ) after the environment name for the unnumbered version: gather* , multline* , etc. Matrix Environments Specialized environments for matrices and arrays: $$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\\\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \\end{pmatrix} $$ `matrix' - Plain matrix (no delimiters) `pmatrix' - Matrix with parentheses ( ) bmatrix - Matrix with brackets [ ] `vmatrix' - Matrix with single bars | | `Vmatrix' - Matrix with double bars || || `smallmatrix' - Compact inline matrix Previewing Math Fragments Hover Preview To preview any LaTeX math expression: Position your cursor over the math expression Wait briefly or hover with your mouse A tooltip appears showing the rendered equation The preview displays: The rendered equation as an image (SVG or PNG) Equation number (if applicable) The original LaTeX source code Preview Caching Rendered equations are cached in your VS Code global storage directory. The cache: Speeds up repeated hover previews Persists between VS Code sessions Automatically cleans up entries older than 7 days Stores separate versions for light and dark modes Clearing the Cache To clear all cached equation renders: Open Command Palette ( C-S-P / s-S-P ) Run: Scimax: Clear LaTeX Cache To view cache statistics: Open Command Palette Run: Scimax: Show LaTeX Cache Statistics This displays: Number of cached equations Total cache size on disk LaTeX Fragment Settings Document-Level Configuration Add LaTeX configuration at the top of your org file using #+LATEX_HEADER: keywords.

When enabled, image links are rendered as thumbnails directly in the editor, allowing you to preview images without opening them separately. This feature enhances the visual experience of working with org documents that contain images, such as: Scientific notebooks with plots and diagrams Documentation with screenshots and illustrations Journal entries with photos Results from source block executions (especially Jupyter) ✅ How Image Overlays Work CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:07] Due to VS Code's limitations compared to Emacs overlays, the extension uses Hover Previews - Full-size image preview when hovering over image links Thumbnails are automatically generated and cached for performance, using ImageMagick or native macOS tools when available. ✅ Supported Image Formats CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:07] The image overlay system supports the following image formats: Format Extension(s) Notes PNG .png Fully supported JPEG .jpg, .jpeg Fully supported GIF .gif Fully supported (static frames) SVG .svg Scalable vector graphics WebP .webp Modern web format BMP .bmp Bitmap images TIFF .tiff, .tif Tagged image format ICO .ico Icon files ✅ Image Link Syntax CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:07] ✅ Basic Image Links CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:07] The simplest way to include an image is with a basic link: [[./plot.png]] This displays the image inline and can be clicked to open. ✅ File Protocol Links CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 14:08] You can explicitly use the file: protocol: [[file:./plot.png]] Both formats work identically - the file: prefix is optional for local files. ⚠️ Links with Descriptions Add descriptive text that appears as a clickable link: [[./path/to/image.png][My beautiful diagram]] [[file:./screenshots/demo.png][Demo Screenshot]] The description text is shown in the editor, while the image overlay appears in the gutter or inline. ⚠️ Absolute vs Relative Paths Both absolute and relative paths are supported: # Relative to current file [[./images/figure1.png]] [[../shared/logo.png]] # Absolute paths [[file:/home/user/documents/image.png]] [[file:~/Pictures/photo.jpg]] The ~ (tilde) is expanded to the home directory on Unix-like systems. ⚠️ Remote Images Remote image URLs are not displayed as overlays but are still valid links: [[https://example.com/image.png]] [[http://server.com/photo.jpg]] These links work for navigation but won't show thumbnails in the editor. ⚠️ Image Sizing and Attributes ⚠️ ATTR_ORG Keyword Control how images are displayed using the #+ATTR_ORG: keyword above the image link: #+ATTR_ORG: :width 400 [[./diagram.png]] ⚠️ Supported Attributes Attribute Purpose Example :width Image width (export) :width 400 :height Image height (export) :height 300 :scale Scale factor (export) :scale 0.5 :align Alignment (export) :align center :alt Alt text (export) :alt \"Description\" ⚠️ Export-Specific Attributes For LaTeX and HTML export, use backend-specific attributes: #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.8\\textwidth :placement [htbp] #+ATTR_HTML: :width 600px :class figure [[file:./architecture.png]] See Export Documentation for more details on export attributes. ⚠️ Adding Captions Add captions that appear in exports: #+CAPTION: System Architecture Diagram #+NAME: fig:architecture [[file:./architecture.png]] ⚠️ Enabling and Disabling Image Display ⚠️ Global Toggle Toggle image overlays for all org files: Command: Scimax: Toggle Image Overlays Command ID: scimax.imageOverlays.toggle Use the command palette (C-S-P / s-S-P) and search for \"Toggle Image Overlays\". ⚠️ Per-File Toggle Toggle image overlays for the current file only: Command: Scimax: Toggle Image Overlays for Current File Command ID: scimax.imageOverlays.toggleCurrentFile This is useful when you want overlays disabled for one specific large document but enabled globally. ⚠️ Via Configuration Permanently enable or disable in your settings.json: { \"scimax.imageOverlays.enabled\": true } Set to false to disable by default. ⚠️ Configuration Settings ⚠️ scimax.imageOverlays.enabled Enable or disable inline image thumbnails globally. { \"scimax.imageOverlays.enabled\": true } ⚠️ scimax.imageOverlays.maxWidth Maximum width in pixels for thumbnail icons. Thumbnails are scaled down to fit within these dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio. { \"scimax.imageOverlays.maxWidth\": 128 } ⚠️ scimax.imageOverlays.maxHeight Maximum height in pixels for thumbnail icons. { \"scimax.imageOverlays.maxHeight\": 128 } ⚠️ scimax.imageOverlays.renderMode Controls where image thumbnails are displayed: gutter - Show thumbnail in the editor gutter (line margin) - recommended after - Show emoji and dimensions inline after the link text both - Show both gutter thumbnail and inline decoration { \"scimax.imageOverlays.renderMode\": \"gutter\" } Use gutter for a clean, unobtrusive experience Use after if you prefer inline indicators Use both for maximum visibility ⚠️ scimax.imageOverlays.onlyWhenCursorNotInLink Hide the overlay when your cursor is inside the image link. This prevents the thumbnail from obscuring the link text you're editing. { \"scimax.imageOverlays.onlyWhenCursorNotInLink\": true } Set to false to always show overlays, even when editing. ⚠️ scimax.imageOverlays.excludePatterns Regex patterns for image paths to exclude from overlay display. Useful for hiding certain directories or file patterns. { \"scimax.imageOverlays.excludePatterns\": [ \"\\\\.tmp/\", \"/archive/\", \"draft-.*\\\\.png\" ] } Examples: \"\\\\.tmp/\" - Exclude images in .tmp directories \"^http\" - Exclude remote URLs (already excluded by default) \"screenshot-.*\" - Exclude files starting with \"screenshot-\" ⚠️ scimax.imageOverlays.maxOverlaysPerDocument Maximum number of image overlays to display per document. This prevents performance issues in documents with hundreds of images. { \"scimax.imageOverlays.maxOverlaysPerDocument\": 500 } If your document exceeds this limit, you'll see a warning message. ⚠️ scimax.imageOverlays.showDimensions When using after or both render modes, show image dimensions (e.g., \"800x600\") in the inline decoration. { \"scimax.imageOverlays.showDimensions\": true } ⚠️ scimax.imageOverlays.cacheEnabled Enable thumbnail caching for faster loading. Thumbnails are stored in the extension's global storage directory. { \"scimax.imageOverlays.cacheEnabled\": true } Set to false to disable caching (may impact performance). ⚠️ Images from Source Block Results ⚠️ Automatic Image Display When source blocks produce image output, the results are automatically displayed as overlays: ,#+BEGIN_SRC python :results file import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100) y = np.sin(x) plt.plot(x, y) plt.savefig('plot.png') 'plot.png' ,#+END_SRC ,#+RESULTS: [[file:plot.png]] The resulting link automatically shows as an overlay. ⚠️ Jupyter Kernel Output Jupyter kernels automatically save image output to the .ob-jupyter/ directory: ,#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session py import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 9, 16]) plt.show() ,#+END_SRC ,#+RESULTS: [[file:.ob-jupyter/output-1705171200000-0.png]] These images are automatically displayed as overlays when image overlays are enabled. See Jupyter Documentation for more details on Jupyter integration. ⚠️ R and Other Languages R, Julia, and other languages that produce image files work similarly: ,#+BEGIN_SRC R :results file graphics :file myplot.png plot(1:10, (1:10)^2) ,#+END_SRC ,#+RESULTS: [[file:myplot.png]] ⚠️ Available Commands ⚠️ Scimax: Toggle Image Overlays Toggle image overlays globally for all org files. When disabled, no thumbnails are shown but links remain functional. ⚠️ Scimax: Toggle Image Overlays for Current File Toggle image overlays for the currently active org file only. Useful for temporarily hiding overlays in specific documents. ⚠️ Scimax: Refresh Image Overlays Manually refresh all image overlays in visible editors. This can be useful if: You've modified image files externally Overlays aren't updating correctly You've changed configuration settings ⚠️ Scimax: Clear Image Overlay Cache Clear the thumbnail cache. This will: Delete all cached thumbnails Free up disk space Force thumbnails to be regenerated on next display Useful if thumbnails are corrupted or you want to reclaim space. ⚠️ Scimax: Show Image Overlay Cache Statistics Display information about the thumbnail cache: Number of cached thumbnails Total cache size in KB Useful for monitoring cache usage. ⚠️ Troubleshooting Image Display ⚠️ Images Not Showing If image overlays aren't displaying: Check if overlays are enabled: Verify the image file exists: Check the file extension: Try refreshing: Check exclude patterns: ⚠️ Overlays Disappear When Editing This is normal behavior when scimax.imageOverlays.onlyWhenCursorNotInLink is true (default). The overlay hides when your cursor is inside the link to prevent obscuring the text you're editing.

The database provides: Full-text search with FTS5 (SQLite's Full-Text Search) and BM25 ranking Semantic search using vector embeddings for meaning-based queries Hybrid search combining keyword and semantic approaches Structured queries for headings, TODOs, tags, properties, and links Agenda views for scheduled items and deadlines Code block search filtered by programming language The database is built on SQLite (via @libsql/client ) with support for vector similarity search, making it both fast and capable of sophisticated semantic queries. What Gets Indexed File Types The database automatically indexes three types of files: `.org' files - Org-mode documents `.md' files - Markdown documents `.ipynb' files - Jupyter notebooks Indexed Content For each file, the database extracts and indexes: Headings Heading text and level (*, **, ***, etc.) TODO states (TODO, DONE, IN-PROGRESS, etc.) Priority markers ([#A], [#B], [#C]) Tags (both direct and inherited) Properties (CUSTOM_ID, CATEGORY, etc.) Scheduling information (SCHEDULED, DEADLINE, CLOSED) Line numbers for navigation Source Blocks Programming language Complete code content Header arguments ( :results , :exports , etc.) Line numbers For notebooks: cell indices Links Link type (file, http, https, id, etc.) Target path or URL Optional description text Line number Hashtags Inline hashtags (e.g., #research, #todo) Associated file paths Full Text Complete document content for full-text search Indexed with FTS5 virtual tables Porter stemming and Unicode normalization Text Chunks (for Semantic Search) Document divided into ~2000 character chunks 3-line overlap between chunks for context Vector embeddings (if embedding service configured) Line ranges for each chunk File Watching The database automatically watches for file changes: New files are indexed when created Modified files are re-indexed (debounced with 500ms delay) Deleted files are removed from the index Changes are queued and processed sequentially Ignore Patterns By default, the following patterns are ignored: **/node_modules/** **/.git/** **/dist/** **/build/** **/.ipynb_checkpoints/** Configure additional patterns in settings: scimax.db.ignorePatterns Full-Text Search Overview Full-text search uses SQLite's FTS5 (Full-Text Search version 5) with: BM25 ranking - Industry-standard relevance scoring Porter stemming - Matches word variations (e.g., \"run\" matches \"running\") Unicode normalization - Handles accented characters correctly Snippet generation - Shows matching context with highlighting Usage Command Run Scimax: Search All Files (FTS5) or use command scimax.db.search Query Syntax FTS5 supports rich query syntax: Basic Queries machine learning # Match both words (in any order) \"machine learning\" # Match exact phrase neural OR artificial # Match either word Boolean Operators python AND jupyter # Must contain both python NOT tensorflow # Contains python but not tensorflow deep OR machine learning # Contains \"deep\" or the phrase \"machine learning\" Prefix Matching comput* # Matches: computer, computing, computation data* # Matches: data, database, dataset Column Queries title: introduction # Search only in titles content: python # Search only in content Proximity Queries NEAR(neural network, 5) # Words within 5 tokens of each other Results Search results include: File path and basename Line number Preview snippet with `<mark>' tags highlighting matches BM25 relevance score Up to 100 results (configurable) Example Searches # Find all references to \"gradient descent\" gradient descent # Find Python-related TODO items TODO python # Find documents about data science or machine learning \"data science\" OR \"machine learning\" # Find recent mentions of TensorFlow (excluding Keras) tensorflow NOT keras # Find all documents with \"introduction\" in title title: introduction Semantic Search Overview Semantic search finds content by meaning rather than exact keywords. It uses vector embeddings to represent text in a high-dimensional space where semantically similar content is close together. Benefits: Find content even when using different words Discover related concepts More natural query language Example: Searching for \"machine learning algorithms\" will also find documents about \"neural networks\", \"deep learning models\", and \"classification methods\" even if they don't contain those exact words. Requirements Semantic search requires: Vector search support in libsql - The database must support vector operations Embedding provider configured - One of: local (Transformers.js), Ollama, or OpenAI Files indexed with embeddings - Run scimax.db.reindex after configuring Checking Availability Run Scimax: Show Database Stats ( scimax.db.stats ) to see: Whether vector search is supported Number of embeddings stored Any error messages If vector search is unavailable, the stats will show: Semantic search: Unavailable (vector search not supported) Fallback to Full-Text Search If semantic search is unavailable, use full-text search (`scimax.db.search') instead. FTS5 is always available and very fast for keyword-based queries. Embedding Providers Scimax supports three embedding providers: Local (Transformers.js) - Recommended Pros : Free, private, no external services needed Cons : Slower initial model download (~30MB) Models : Ollama Pros : Free, private, local control Cons : Requires Ollama installed and running Models : Setup : Install Ollama, then ollama pull nomic-embed-text OpenAI Pros : High quality, fast, maintained Cons : Requires API key, costs money, sends data to cloud Models : Configuration Interactive Setup Run Scimax: Configure Embedding Service ( scimax.db.configureEmbeddings ) This wizard will: Let you choose a provider Select a model Test the connection Update your settings Prompt you to reindex files Manual Configuration Add to your VS Code settings ( settings.json ): Local (Transformers.js) { \"scimax.db.embeddingProvider\": \"local\", \"scimax.db.localModel\": \"Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\" } Ollama { \"scimax.db.embeddingProvider\": \"ollama\", \"scimax.db.ollamaUrl\": \"http://localhost:11434\", \"scimax.db.ollamaModel\": \"nomic-embed-text\" } OpenAI { \"scimax.db.embeddingProvider\": \"openai\", \"scimax.db.openaiApiKey\": \"sk-...\" } Usage Command Run Scimax: Semantic Search or use command scimax.db.searchSemantic Query Examples Semantic search uses natural language: # Conceptual searches explain neural network architecture how to optimize database queries project management best practices # Related concept discovery clustering algorithms # Finds: k-means, hierarchical, DBSCAN data visualization # Finds: matplotlib, charts, plots, graphs # Question answering what is gradient descent how does attention mechanism work Results Results include: File path and line number Preview (first 200 characters of chunk) Similarity score (0-100%, higher is more relevant) Cosine distance (lower is more similar) Up to 20 results by default Reindexing for Semantic Search After configuring an embedding provider, you must reindex your files: Run Scimax: Reindex Files ( scimax.db.reindex ) Wait for indexing to complete The database will generate embeddings for all text chunks Semantic search will now be available Hybrid Search Overview Hybrid search combines full-text (keyword) and semantic (vector) search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). This approach: Gets the best of both worlds Balances exact matches with conceptual similarity Provides more robust results Usage Command Run Scimax: Hybrid Search or use command scimax.db.searchHybrid How It Works Query runs through both FTS5 and vector search Results from each are ranked RRF algorithm combines rankings: Final results sorted by combined score Weights Default weights are 50/50, but can be adjusted: // Internal API (for extension developers) db.searchHybrid(query, { limit: 20, ftsWeight: 0.5, // 50% weight on keywords vectorWeight: 0.5 // 50% weight on semantics }); When to Use Hybrid Default choice for general searches When you want both exact matches and related concepts When query has both specific terms and broad concepts Example: \"python sklearn classification accuracy\" - finds both sklearn-specific code and general ML accuracy discussions Results Results include: Combined ranking score Source indicator (Keywords, AI, or both) File location and preview Up to 20 results Structured Queries Beyond free-text search, the database supports structured queries for specific content types. Heading Search Search specifically in headings, with optional filtering: Command Scimax: Search Headings ( scimax.db.searchHeadings ) Features Search by heading text Filter by TODO state Filter by tag Shows heading level, tags, TODO state Displays deadlines and scheduled dates Example Use Cases # Find all headings about Python python # Find TODOs with specific tag (use Tag Search) :work: # Browse document structure <empty query> Tag Search Search headings by org-mode tags: Command Scimax: Search By Tag ( scimax.db.searchByTag ) Features Lists all tags found in indexed files Shows heading count per tag Supports both direct and inherited tags Tags displayed as :tagname: Property Search Search headings by property drawer values: Command Scimax: Search By Property ( scimax.db.searchByProperty ) Common Properties CUSTOM_ID # Unique identifiers for linking ID # Auto-generated UUIDs CATEGORY # Classification CREATED # Creation timestamp MODIFIED # Last modification time Examples # Find all entries with CATEGORY property Property: CATEGORY Value: <empty> # Find entries with specific CATEGORY Property: CATEGORY Value: research # Find entries with CUSTOM_ID Property: CUSTOM_ID Value: <empty or specific> TODO Search Browse and filter TODO items: Command Scimax: Show TODOs ( scimax.db.showTodos ) Features Lists all TODO items across workspace Filter by state (TODO, DONE, IN-PROGRESS, etc.) Shows priority,...","headings":"Overview What Gets Indexed File Types Indexed Content Headings Source Blocks Links Hashtags Full Text Text Chunks (for Semantic Search) File Watching Ignore Patterns Full-Text Search Overview Usage Command Query Syntax Results Example Searches Semantic Search Overview Requirements Checking Availability Fallback to Full-Text Search Embedding Providers Local (Transformers.js) - Recommended Ollama OpenAI Configuration Interactive Setup Manual Configuration Usage Command Query Examples Results Reindexing for Semantic Search Hybrid Search Overview Usage Command How It Works Weights When to Use Hybrid Results Structured Queries Heading Search Command Features Example Use Cases Tag Search Command Features Property Search Command Common Properties Examples TODO Search Command Features Common TODO States Source Block Search Command Features Example Workflow Hashtag Search Command Features Hashtag Format File Browser Command Features Agenda and Time Management Agenda View Command Time Periods Options Item Types Deadline View Command Features Display Format Date Formats Scheduling in Org Files Relative Dates Search Scope Commands Scope Types All Files (Default) Current Directory Current Scope Indicator Database Management Reindexing Full Reindex Auto-Indexing Additional Directories Optimization Command Operations Clearing Database Command Warning When to Clear Statistics Command Information Displayed Stats Include Performance Considerations Indexing Performance File Size Batch Indexing Optimization Tips Search Performance Full-Text Search (FTS5) Semantic Search Hybrid Search Database Size Typical Sizes With Embeddings Memory Usage Indexing Searching Scaling Guidelines Small Workspace (<100 files) Medium Workspace (100-1,000 files) Large Workspace (1,000-10,000 files) Very Large Workspace (>10,000 files) Configuration Reference Database Settings `scimax.db.directories' `scimax.db.ignorePatterns' `scimax.db.autoIndex' Embedding Settings `scimax.db.embeddingProvider' `scimax.db.localModel' `scimax.db.ollamaUrl' `scimax.db.ollamaModel' `scimax.db.openaiApiKey' Command Reference Search Commands View Commands Management Commands Troubleshooting Semantic Search Not Working Problem First: Check Vector Search Support Vector Search Unavailable Embedding Provider Issues Local Provider Issues Ollama Issues OpenAI Issues Search Returns No Results Problem Solutions Slow Indexing Problem Solutions Database Corruption Problem Solutions High Memory Usage Problem Solutions Examples and Workflows Research Paper Management Project Todo Management Code Snippet Library Personal Knowledge Base Best Practices Indexing Strategy Search Strategy Organization Tips Performance Tips Technical Architecture Database Schema Files Table Headings Table Source Blocks Table Links Table Hashtags Table Chunks Table FTS Content (Virtual Table) Indexes Vector Search Parsers Org Mode Markdown Jupyter Notebooks See Also Navigation"},{"id":"19-references.html","title":"References and Citations","content":"Overview Scimax VS Code provides comprehensive bibliography and citation management inspired by Emacs org-ref.

Inspired by org-journal and bullet journaling, it provides a structured yet flexible way to capture thoughts, tasks, and logs throughout your day. ⚠️ Key Features Automatic date-based organization with hierarchical directory structure Multiple customizable templates for different journaling styles Built-in calendar view for visualizing and navigating entries Quick navigation between entries with keyboard shortcuts Full-text search across all journal entries Statistics tracking including writing streaks and word counts Quick capture for timestamped log entries Status bar integration showing current entry details Tree view for browsing entries by year, month, and day ⚠️ Philosophy The journal system is designed around the principle of friction-free capture. With a single keyboard shortcut (C-S-J), you can open today's journal entry and start writing. The system handles all organization automatically, storing files in a sensible directory structure that mirrors the calendar. ⚠️ Getting Started ⚠️ Opening Your First Journal Entry The quickest way to start journaling is to press C-S-J (s-S-J on Mac). This will: Create today's journal entry if it doesn't exist Apply your default template Open the file in the editor Your first entry might look like this: #+TITLE: 2026-01-14 - Tuesday #+DATE: 2026-01-14 ,* Tasks - [ ] ,* Notes ,* Log ⚠️ Directory Structure By default, journal entries are stored in ~/scimax-journal with the following structure: ~/scimax-journal/ ├── 2026/ │ ├── 01/ │ │ ├── 14/ │ │ │ └── 2026-01-14.org │ │ ├── 15/ │ │ │ └── 2026-01-15.org │ │ └── 16/ │ │ └── 2026-01-16.org │ └── 02/ │ └── 01/ │ └── 2026-02-01.org └── .scimax/ └── templates/ ├── custom.org └── meeting.org Each entry is stored in a path like YYYY/MM/DD/YYYY-MM-DD.org, making it easy to browse chronologically while keeping the directory structure manageable. ⚠️ Configuration Configure the journal system through VS Code settings (File > Preferences > Settings or C-,): ⚠️ scimax.journal.directory Directory where journal files are stored. If empty, defaults to ~/scimax-journal. { \"scimax.journal.directory\": \"~/Documents/journal\" } You can also use absolute paths or paths starting with ~ for your home directory. ⚠️ scimax.journal.format Choose between org-mode or Markdown format for journal entries. { \"scimax.journal.format\": \"org\" // or \"markdown\" } Default: org ⚠️ scimax.journal.template The default template to use when creating new entries. { \"scimax.journal.template\": \"default\" } Available built-in templates: default, minimal, research, meeting, standup ⚠️ scimax.journal.dateFormat Date format for file names (currently only YYYY-MM-DD is supported). { \"scimax.journal.dateFormat\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\" } Default: YYYY-MM-DD ⚠️ scimax.journal.autoTimestamp Automatically add timestamps when using the quick log feature. { \"scimax.journal.autoTimestamp\": true } Default: true ⚠️ scimax.journal.weekStartsOn First day of the week for calendar and week views. { \"scimax.journal.weekStartsOn\": \"monday\" // or \"sunday\" } Default: monday ⚠️ Journal Templates Templates define the structure of new journal entries. Scimax provides several built-in templates and supports custom templates. ⚠️ Built-in Templates ⚠️ default A balanced template suitable for general daily journaling with tasks, notes, and a timestamped log. #+TITLE: {{date}} - {{weekday}} #+DATE: {{date}} ,* Tasks - [ ] ,* Notes ,* Log ⚠️ minimal A minimal template with just a notes section, ideal for free-form journaling. #+TITLE: {{date}} #+DATE: {{date}} ,* Notes ⚠️ research Designed for research work, with sections for goals, experiments, results, and references. #+TITLE: Research Log - {{date}} #+DATE: {{date}} #+AUTHOR: {{author}} ,* Goals for Today - [ ] ,* Experiments ,* Results ,* Next Steps ,* References ⚠️ meeting Structured template for meeting notes with attendees, agenda, and action items. #+TITLE: Meeting Notes - {{date}} #+DATE: {{date}} ,* Attendees - ,* Agenda 1. ,* Discussion ,* Action Items - [ ] ,* Next Meeting ⚠️ standup Daily standup format with yesterday, today, and blockers. #+TITLE: Standup - {{date}} #+DATE: {{date}} ,* Yesterday - ,* Today - ,* Blockers - ⚠️ Template Variables Templates support the following variables that are automatically substituted: Variable Description Example {{date}} ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) 2026-01-14 {{year}} Four-digit year 2026 {{month}} Two-digit month 01 {{day}} Two-digit day 14 {{weekday}} Day of week name Tuesday {{monthName}} Full month name January {{timestamp}} ISO timestamp 2026-01-14T10:30Z {{author}} Currently returns empty, reserved for future use ⚠️ Creating Custom Templates Custom templates are stored in <journal-directory>/.scimax templates . Create a new template by: Create the templates directory if it doesn't exist: Create a template file with the same extension as your journal format (.org or .md): Edit the template file with your desired structure: Use the template when creating a new entry: ⚠️ Markdown Templates If you configure the journal format as Markdown, the built-in templates use Markdown syntax: # {{date}} - {{weekday}} ## Tasks - [ ] ## Notes ## Log Custom Markdown templates work the same way, but use the .md extension. ⚠️ Creating Journal Entries ⚠️ Today's Entry Press C-S-J (s-S-J on Mac) or run the command Scimax: Open Today's Journal. This is the fastest way to start journaling. If today's entry doesn't exist, it will be created using your default template. ⚠️ New Entry for Any Date To create an entry for a different date: Run command: Scimax: New Journal Entry Select a template Enter a date in YYYY-MM-DD format (or leave empty for today) If an entry already exists for that date, you'll be asked if you want to open it instead. Example workflow for creating a meeting note: C-S-P → Scimax: New Journal Entry Select meeting template Press Enter to use today's date Entry is created and opened ⚠️ Using Different Templates You can create multiple entries for the same date using different templates by: Running Scimax: New Journal Entry multiple times Selecting different templates each time However, only one file per date is stored. To use multiple templates in one day, either: Merge content manually Use a comprehensive custom template Create separate files outside the journal system ⚠️ Navigating Journal Entries ⚠️ Keyboard Navigation When viewing a journal entry: M-[ - Go to previous entry M-] - Go to next entry These shortcuts only work when the current file is a journal entry (filename matches YYYY-MM-DD.org or .md). ⚠️ Go to Specific Date Run Scimax: Go to Journal Date to see a list of all your entries: > Scimax: Go to Journal Date 📅 2026-01-14 Tue 📅 2026-01-13 Mon 📅 2026-01-12 Sun 📅 2026-01-10 Fri ...

It enables quick switching between projects, intelligent project detection, and project-scoped operations for efficient multi-project workflows. ✅ What is Projectile? CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 19:55] Projectile is a project management system that: Automatically detects projects based on version control markers (`.git'), special files (`.projectile'), or manual registration Maintains a list of known projects with quick-switch capabilities Provides project-scoped file search and text search Remembers recently accessed projects Integrates with the notebook system for research project organization Tracks project metadata including type and last access time Projects can be: Git repositories : Directories containing a .git folder Projectile-marked : Directories with a .projectile marker file Manual projects : Any directory you explicitly add to the project list ✅ Key Features CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 19:55] Automatic Detection : Discovers git repos and projectile-marked directories Quick Switching : Fast navigation between known projects with C-c p p Project History : Shows when each project was last opened Batch Scanning : Scan directories to discover multiple projects at once File Finding : Project-scoped file search with C-c p f Text Search : Search within project files with C-c p s Tree View : Sidebar showing all known projects with visual indicators Cleanup Tools : Remove non-existent projects from the list Notebook Integration : Works seamlessly with scimax-notebook for research projects ✅ Project Detection CLOSED: [2026-01-15 Thu 19:55] Detection Methods Scimax uses three methods to detect projects, in this priority order: Git Repositories : Any directory containing a .git/ subdirectory Projectile Markers : Directories with a .projectile file Manual Registration : Projects you explicitly add via commands Automatic Detection When you open a workspace folder, Scimax automatically registers it as a project: # Opening a folder registers it automatically $ code /home/user/my-project/ # The folder is now in your project list # Type: git (if it has .git) or manual (otherwise) Creating a Projectile Marker To mark a directory as a projectile project, create an empty .projectile file in the root: # Create marker file touch .projectile # Now Scimax recognizes this as a project The `.projectile' file can be empty or contain patterns for ignoring files (reserved for future use). Project Types Projects are classified into three types: Type Marker Icon Description git .git/ Git branch Git repository projectile .projectile File icon Marked with .projectile file manual (none) Folder icon Manually added directory The type is automatically detected when adding a project. Managing Projects Switching Between Projects The primary projectile command is Switch Project ( C-c p p ): Command: Scimax: Switch Project Keybinding: C-c p p Hydra: Projects → p (Switch Project) This opens a quick pick menu showing: Project name Full path Project type (git, projectile, or manual) Last opened time (e.g., \"2h ago\", \"3d ago\") Select a project to choose how to open it: Option Result New Window Opens project in a new VS Code window Current Window Replaces current workspace with project Add to Workspace Adds project to current multi-root workspace Example workflow: 1. Press C-c p p 2. Type to filter: \"scimax\" 3. Select \"scimax_vscode\" 4. Choose \"New Window\" → Project opens in new VS Code window → Last opened time is updated Adding Projects Manually Adding a Project Use Scimax: Add Project ( C-c p a ): Command: Scimax: Add Project Keybinding: C-c p a Hydra: Projects → a (Add Project) This opens a folder picker. Select any directory to add it to your project list. 1. Press C-c p a 2. Navigate to /home/user/projects/my-app/ 3. Select folder → \"Added project: my-app\" → Project appears in the list Scanning for Projects To discover multiple projects at once, use Scimax: Scan Directory for Projects : Command: Scimax: Scan Directory for Projects Keybinding: (none) Hydra: Projects → s (Scan for Projects) Scanning process: Select a parent directory to scan Enter maximum depth (default: 2 levels deep) Scimax searches for git repos and .projectile markers Found projects are added automatically Example: Scan directory: /home/user/projects/ Max depth: 2 # Finds and adds: /home/user/projects/project-a/ (git) /home/user/projects/project-b/ (git) /home/user/projects/work/client-site/ (git) /home/user/projects/notes/journal/ (projectile) Result: \"Found 4 projects\" The scanner: Skips hidden directories (starting with `.') Stops descending into detected projects Handles permission errors gracefully Shows progress notification Removing Projects Remove projects from the list with Scimax: Remove Project : Command: Scimax: Remove Project Keybinding: (none) Hydra: Projects → r (Remove Project) Notes: This removes the project from the known projects list only It does not delete any files from disk The project can be re-added at any time Cleaning Up Projects Over time, projects may be moved or deleted. Use Scimax: Cleanup Non-existent Projects : Command: Scimax: Cleanup Non-existent Projects Keybinding: (none) This scans all known projects and removes entries for directories that no longer exist on disk. Known projects: 15 Checking each path... Removed: /home/user/old-project (not found) Removed: /tmp/temp-project (not found) Result: \"Cleaned up 2 non-existent projects\" Run this periodically to keep your project list clean. Project Operations Finding Files in Projects Find files within the current project using Scimax: Find File in Project ( C-c p f ): Command: Scimax: Find File in Project Keybinding: C-c p f Hydra: Projects → f (Find File) This delegates to VS Code's built-in quick open (`C-p'), which automatically scopes to workspace folders. Features: Fuzzy matching (e.g., \"orgpar\" matches \"orgParser.ts\") Recent files appear first Respects .gitignore and VS Code ignore patterns Fast indexing with intelligent caching Example: C-c p f Type: \"babelProv\" → Matches: src/org/babelProvider.ts → Press Enter to open Searching in Projects Search for text within project files using Scimax: Search in Project ( C-c p s ): Command: Scimax: Search in Project Keybinding: C-c p s Hydra: Projects → g (Search in Project) This opens VS Code's search panel pre-scoped to the current workspace. Search features: Regular expression support Case sensitivity toggle Whole word matching Include/exclude file patterns Replace across all matches Example workflow: 1. Press C-c p s 2. Search panel opens 3. Enter search: \"executeSourceBlock\" 4. Results show all matches in project 5. Click to navigate to each match Opening Project Root Navigate to the project root in the file explorer with Scimax: Open Project Root ( C-c p d ): Command: Scimax: Open Project Root Keybinding: C-c p d Hydra: (none) For multi-root workspaces, you'll be asked to select which project root to reveal. Project Information View details about the current project with Scimax: Project Info : Command: Scimax: Project Info Keybinding: (none) Displays: Project name Full path Project type (git, projectile, manual) Last opened timestamp Whether it's tracked by projectile Example output: Name: scimax_vscode Path: /home/user/scimax_vscode Type: git Last opened: 2026-01-13 14:32:15 Projects Tree View Sidebar Panel The Projects tree view appears in the Scimax sidebar, showing all known projects. To open the sidebar: View → Open View... → Scimax Projects Tree View Elements Each project in the tree shows: Icon : Name : Project directory name Description : Tree Interactions Click a project to open it: Same behavior as `C-c p p' (Switch Project) Choose New Window, Current Window, or Add to Workspace Right-click (context menu) actions: Refresh tree view Remove project Show project info Refreshing the Tree The tree auto-refreshes when: Projects are added or removed Workspace folders change Projects are accessed (last opened time updates) Manual refresh: Command: Scimax: Refresh Projects Icon: Refresh button in tree view toolbar Recent Projects Sorting by Last Access Projects are sorted by last opened time, with the most recently accessed appearing first: Project List: 1. scimax_vscode (just now) # ← Currently open 2. my-research (2h ago) # ← Recently used 3. client-website (3d ago) 4. old-notes (2024-11-15) # ← Long time ago This ordering makes it quick to switch back to recently used projects.

They provide quick access to Scimax commands through persistent, modal menus that remain open until you explicitly close them or execute an exit command. ✅ What Are Hydra Menus? CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 07:36] A hydra menu is a quick pick interface that displays available commands organized into logical groups. Each command is associated with a single keyboard shortcut, allowing you to rapidly execute actions without navigating through multiple menus or remembering complex key combinations. Think of hydra menus as command palettes optimized for keyboard efficiency: Single-key selection (no Enter needed) Commands stay organized in logical groups Menus can stay open for repeated actions Hierarchical navigation with submenus Visual indicators for toggles and persistent actions ✅ Key Features CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 07:37] Fast keyboard-driven navigation with single-key selection Organized command groups with descriptive labels and icons Persistent menus that stay open for repeated actions (red heads) Exit-after-action commands (blue heads) Submenu navigation for hierarchical organization Toggle indicators showing on/off state Conditional visibility based on context Customizable through VS Code settings Full integration with all Scimax features ✅ Philosophy CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 07:37] The hydra system is designed around the principle of discoverability and efficiency. Instead of memorizing dozens of keyboard shortcuts, you can press `C-c m' to open the main menu and see all available commands with their shortcuts. Once you learn commonly-used shortcuts, you can invoke them directly without opening the menu. ✅ Getting Started CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 07:37] Opening the Main Menu The fastest way to access hydra menus is through the main menu: Press `C-c m' to open the main Scimax menu Press `C-c C-m' for a context-aware menu based on the current file type You can also open menus through the command palette: Press C/cmd-S-P Type \"Scimax: Main Menu\" or \"Scimax: Show Hydra Menu\" Press Enter ✅ Basic Navigation CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 07:39] When a hydra menu is open: Press a single key to execute the corresponding command Type multiple characters to filter the list Use arrow keys to navigate Press Enter to execute the selected command Press Escape or Backspace (when a parent menu exists) to close or go back 👀 Understanding Exit Behaviors Each menu item has one of three exit behaviors, indicated by icons in the interface. Note: The terms \"Blue Head\" and \"Red Head\" come from Emacs Hydra, which uses colored text. VS Code's QuickPick API doesn't support per-item colors, so we use icons instead. 👀 Exit (Blue Head) - $(sign-out) The menu closes after executing the command. Most commands use this behavior. These items are marked with a $(sign-out) icon (exit door). [t] Today $(sign-out) → Opens today's journal and closes menu [s] Search $(sign-out) → Starts search and closes menu 👀 Stay (Red Head) - $(sync) The menu remains open after executing the command, allowing you to execute it multiple times or try different commands. These items are marked with a $(sync) icon (circular arrows). [r] Refresh $(sync) → Refreshes data and keeps menu open [i] Index File $(sync) → Indexes file and keeps menu open Submenu - $(chevron-right) Navigates to a child menu. These items are marked with a $(chevron-right) icon (arrow). [j] Journal $(chevron-right) → Opens journal submenu [r] References $(chevron-right) → Opens references submenu ✅ Available Hydras CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 07:42] Scimax comes with eight pre-built hydra menus covering all major features: ✅ Main Menu (scimax.main) CLOSED: [2026-01-16 Fri 07:42] The main entry point for all Scimax features.

This is the VS Code equivalent of Emacs org-mode's ability to traverse and modify parse trees using elisp. Use this API in TypeScript source blocks to: Bulk update TODO states across files Extract and transform data from tables Rearrange document structure Generate reports from org data Automate repetitive org file operations Quick Start Basic Example: Change All TODOs to DONE import { org } from 'scimax'; const doc = org.parseFile('./tasks.org'); org.mapHeadlines(doc, h => { if (h.properties.todoKeyword === 'TODO') { org.setTodo(h, 'DONE'); } }); org.writeFile('./tasks.org', doc); Query and Report import { org } from 'scimax'; const doc = org.parseFile('./projects.org'); const todos = org.query(doc, { hasTodo: true, todoType: 'todo' }); console.log(`Found ${todos.length} pending tasks:`); todos.forEach(h => { console.log(` - ${h.properties.rawValue}`); }); API Reference File I/O org.parseFile(path, config?) Parse an org file from disk into an AST. const doc = org.parseFile('./notes.org'); const doc = org.parseFile('/absolute/path/to/file.org'); org.parse(content, config?)

These features are inspired by Emacs packages like org-ref and scimax, and provide additional functionality for scientific writing. This document describes these non-standard features and their behavior during export. ⚠️ org-ref Citation Links The citation system ( cite: , citet: , citep: , etc.) comes from the org-ref package for Emacs, not from core org-mode.

Markdown Export Citations are converted to Pandoc-style citations: Org Citation Pandoc Markdown cite:key [@key] citet:key @key citep:key [@key] cite:k1,k2 [@k1; @k2] Compatibility Notes Emacs org-mode users will find this syntax familiar Standard org-mode uses [[cite:@key]] syntax (org-cite) which is also supported The org-ref style cite:key is more concise for scientific writing See References for full documentation. ⚠️ Emacs-style Command Markup The command markup syntax ` command ' (backtick + text + single quote) is used in Emacs documentation to reference commands, functions, and key sequences. Syntax Use `my-command' to perform the action. Press `C-c C-c' to execute. The `save-buffer' function writes the file. This renders with dark red highlighting in the editor. Keybinding Key Command Description C-c ' scimax.markup.command Insert command markup When text is selected, it wraps the selection.
